0,Gyukatsu MOTOMURA Tokyo Eki Yaesuguchi,5,120,"[""So....this place is well worth whatever wait you might have to go through before you get seated (we waited 2.5 hours). I wasn't sure what I was expecting and I trusted my two friends who are in the know to not steer us wrong for a wonderful food experience. I highly recommend one of their numbered plates (without yam). The differences between plates are the size of beef and yam or no yam. If you like a very gooey yam experience, then get the yam. Me, I am not so adventurous (I did try a bite of yam but still not my thing).You get a wonderfully plated meal and you get to cook the gyukatsu further if you desire and can dip it into the sauces. OMG. It is one of the meals I remember most of this trip and one of the meals I remember most overall in my eating experience. It was so decadent and amazing to take the time to cook each slice of deliciously flavorful beef to perfection. Food is amazing and service is wonderful and efficient, wait can be loooong and hopefully, faster than ours!"", ""Stumbled across this looking for some good beef and was not at all disappointed! There was a bit of a wait but no more than 30-40 minutes. It was nice because it was slightly chilly and there was a generous canteen with tea to have while you waited! So cute! We put in our order while waiting in line but ended up being even hungrier by the time we got inside. We ordered two of the small portion of beef katsu meals but not to worry though, if you find yourself wanting more you can order more. It's important to note that each person must have their own meal-- no sharing allowed. Once inside it makes sense! You are seated right up against the counter where the meal is being prepared with each person receiving their own hot stone plate to cook their meat.Thankfully we met a wonderful couple ahead of us in line who helped us through the meal! So you cook the meat on the hot plate. On the counter in a clear bottle is the vinigrette for the small salad. The soup is miso and there are cups for tea if you would like that is in a larger container on the counter. \xa0The beef is raw so they suggest you cook it on the hot plate, and oh my gosh it is so tender and delicious.. It's making my mouth water just thinking about it. I truly hope you get a chance to experience it \xa0because it was by far our favorite meal in Tokyo!!"", 'Gyukatsu is definitely a must try in Japan and this place was heavenly. I came during lunchtime on a weekday and waited about 20 minutes outside. I got one of the sets that also came with miso soup and various other sides. The beef is so flavorful and tender. I like my meat more on the raw side so I barely cooked it on the stone grill, just around 15 seconds on each side. The sides were delicious as well.', ""A very small place in a small lane. \xa0We walked passed the lane a couple of times, trying to find this place.It fits about 10 people all along the counter by the chefs so that they can pass you your dish. \xa0We didn't know the process so we were standing near the door however there is an area across the lane for you to wait.My girlfriend and I were seated at the very corner so it was super tight to get to. \xa0My girlfriend never had this style of gyukatsu so she was excited about searing the beef.It was delicious and the beef was super tender. \xa0A really good place for gyukatsu. Just don't come as a group as you won't fit."", 'Absolutely fantastic. Super quick service and the Katsu is absolutely fantastic. Crispy/crunchy on outside, rare beef goodness on inside. I think you coming here will be a Super Choice for you all guys come try some new Japanese STUFFS here I am sure you will thank me later for this reviews', ""Absolutely fantastic. Super quick service and the Katsu is absolutely fantastic. Crispy/crunchy on outside, rare beef goodness on inside. Don't know why my neighbors were cooking theirs to well done beside me. Soup and sides were also great with steamed white rice as part of set 1. On a Saturday around 17:00 only one person in line ahead of me. Seated in under 10m. They accept credit cards through a mobile site which uses PayPal. Free WiFi in restaurant too."", ""This was my first gyukatsu experience, and needless to say I am now in love with gyukatsu! We came here on a Sunday for lunch and only had to wait 20 minutes. They take your order and make you pay before you enter so you need to look over the menu while you're waiting in line anyways (English menus are available). I picked Set B which included the gyukatsu, grated yam, roe and other side dishes. The food came out quickly and there were instructions on how each dish should be eaten. Each person also had a mini grill to cook the meat on to their liking since the meat comes out raw. The meat was so tender and absolutely delicious! I also loved the roe and the grated yam, although I overheard other customers complain about the texture. If you don't like slightly slimy things then order Set A which doesn't come with the yam. Everything in the set was well prepared and very worth its price of 1500¥."", 'Ordered: most famous beef katsu setWait time: 1.5 hours Service: fast and efficient Ambiance: super cozy and casual Price: ¥¥Tip: expect to wait, grab a drink and snack \xa0at Lawson while waiting WIGBA (would I go back again) YES', ""Saw a massive line at the Akakusa location the other night, so we decided to try another location as other helpers yelpers had said that there are other branches which were usually not too bad regarding a long wait.Of course if people are standing in the 30 degree weather waiting for a table, that sort of gives you a hint that it may be worth looking into. Well, we decided to do just that tonight and it was awesome! They specialize in Wagyu beef katsu and they only have this on the menu. The only real options are 4 side dishes and the weight of your meat. We had two orders (1 small and 1 medium portions) and had the mochi and tamago as sides. The yam was pretty gross, so I won't get that again. The meat comes fully seasoned and it basically uncooked. They have a neat tabletop stone set up to sear your meat on, which does a great job. Since the meat is very marbled, no oil needed to cook, thats for sure. It was a melt in your mouth experience that we are going to go back for again later!!"", 'A bit on the pricey side.I have never had Gyukatsu (beef katsu), where you sear the meat on a hot stone. The rich and marbled wagyu was very tasty.There was a wait--prob 20 minutes in line before we were seated.I definitely recommend ordering the smaller portion (130g) was way more sufficient. Double the amount was way too much!']"
1,Rokurinsha,4.5,268,"[""Rokurinsha is easy to spot in the ramen alley because it always has the longest line. Also, the logo is pretty recognizable and most likely and easier recommendation because of it. The tsukemen style ramen is arguably the most popular in Japan and this place does it well! Warm broth, cold noodles and richness that you can hardly describe. That's what you can expect from this place. I loved how dense the broth was and the larger noodle made for a different experience. Ordering is traditional and done through the vending machine at entrance. It's a brilliant concept and I don't know why more American eateries haven't adopted this method. If you find yourself in ramen alley, it's worth the wait. :)"", '""As it\'s close to my work, I walk by here quite often. And there\'s always massive queue(which is said that it\'s 2 hours wait)...."" But this was pre-covid. I accidentally walked by here and there was only one dude in the queue! I\'ve already been wanted to try here and thought it was a perfect time. So, I went in. Got myself a ticket for Tsukemen = 850 yen. It came right out as soon as I sat my ass down. It looked quite ordinary Tsukemen. And I had a bite. Yes, it tasted something I had before. Soup got that subtle sweetness that came from simmering seafood for long time. It was quite gentle yet rich. ""Almost udon"" noodle was adequately al dente. The texture was stop on my preference. Overall, I can say that I really enjoyed it but I had to say ""it wasn\'t all that...""It sure isn\'t worth more than one hour wait because I could get something similar elsewhere.', 'We got here early in the morning before taking the bullet train to Kyoto. They are located inside the Tokyo Train Station. Because we came early, there was not that much of a wait, it was about 15 minutes of standing in line. You pay ahead with a machine that gives you a ticket and when you are seated, you give the ticket to the cook for your food. My god the tsukemen (dipping ramen) here was SO delicious. After eating all of your ""dipping ramen"" there is hot water in front of you so you can pour it into the leftover tsukemen sauce so that it becomes a drinkable soup. Again, have to mention Japan\'s soft boiled eggs are just absolutely to die for.', ""The name is Rokurinsha. \xa0Look for the symbol to find your way. \xa0The plate is tsukemen.What is tsukemen, you might ask.While I'm not an expert, I believe it's safe to say that its a cousin of ramen. \xa0The broth is served \xa0apart from the noodles and they're dipped into the broth. \xa0I believe the noodles are cold, wheat noodles. The broth itself is more like a thick curry or gravy with a very strong flavor.It's almost certain you'll have to wait at least \xa0thirty minutes in line, but I felt it was worth it for the experience. \xa0The place is packed with locals, as well as with Western David Change Hipsters. \xa0Yes they're a thing. Rokurinsha. \xa0Look for the symbol to find your way.¡Provecho!"", ""This place changed my life. I feel like it ruined ramen for me in the states. I came for breakfast ramen so the line wasn't so bad. Get the dipping noodles if you're a first timer (or second timer, or third...). The noodles are the perfect amount of chewy and the egg is cooked perfectly. The broth has chunks of pork inside and is thick enough to coat the noodles. When you're done with the noodles, they have broth on the tables so that you can dilute the leftover broth so that it's drinkable like soup. Would come back once a week if I lived in Tokyo.I appreciate places that do just a few things really well and this is one of them."", 'Ramen Street is a bit of a misnomer because it\'s actually a conglomerate of 8 ramen shops in the labyrinth under Tokyo Station. Rokurinsha is one of the most popular ramen joints located on Ramen Street, with waits of ~45 minutes at lunch.Specifically, they\'re known for their Tsukemen (dipping soup) ramen, and that\'s the one we\'d recommend especially having tried both the Tsukemen and the Tonkatsu ramen (traditional pork based ramen). You might be asking yourself, ""What is Tsukemen?"" Well, it\'s essentially deconstructed ramen -- cold noodles on the side and rich, hot soup as the main focal point of the meal. The rich pork and seafood broth is simmered for 13 hours to achieve the rich soup that is meant to serve as a dip for the al dente noodles.The founder, Ryosei Mita, actually studied under the creator of Tsukemen ramen (Kazuo Yamagishi) himself. Explains the popularity.Btw, having tried a few ramen shops throughout Japan, I\'m now of the belief that unless you ordered on a vending machine and they offered you a bib, it\'s not authentic (lol). Clearly, this was spot on.FYI Rokurinsha nabbed the #3 ranked spot on my Tokyo restaurants blog post. To read my other food recommendations in Tokyo, follow: medium.com/artofbasic/3-…', ""Best tsukemen I've ever had! The noodles are so thick and chewy while the broth is so umami and coats the noodles really well. The regular noodle portions are generous so large/extra large noodles would be super filling. I really enjoyed the dipping experience although the broth does run a bit cold by the end. Highly recommend giving this ramen place a try. Lines can be really long since this place is so popular."", ""Had the pleasure to dine at this establishment during my visit to japan and it was sooooo good! We got there around 8 pm on a Tuesday and I was so worried about a long wait but surprisingly the wait was only about 30 min. We ordered off a little ticket machine and got to sit at the counter in front of the chefs. My anticipation was crazy as they placed my food in front of me. I opted for the basic tsukumen with chashu. The food: it was fantastic. The broth was thick and fishier than I expected and unlike any tsukumen I've ever eaten in America. The meat was flavorful and tender. The noodles thick and bouncy and the egg tasted almost like jam? I'm not sure how to describe it but it was glistening. This is what dreams were made of people."", ""Still one of my favorite spots for legit Tsukemen! There's always a line and for a reason, they serve great tasting Tsukemen! The fish pork broth is full of flavor and their noodles were cooked perfect al dente for a nice firm texture. I will always try to eat here whenever I come back to Tokyo!It is an absolute must! No frills no non-sense, just simple great tasting Tsukemen for a great price!"", ""Great food! I came for breakfast ramen so the line wasn't so bad.""]"
2,Kaneko Hannosuke,4.5,74,"[""Lunch hours. ~$10. Tempura to die for. Value for money, you're going to be hard pressed to do better anywhere in the city.Arriving at roughly 11:30am, there was a line fifteen or so deep in a light rain. When you're about five parties from the front, they'll come and take your order. Your order, for the record, is the donburi with or without soup. At least as we had it for lunch, there is no other order.The fillet of eel is tender, and honestly it's wild you're getting a piece this big for the price. Alongside the tempura eel, you get a soft fried egg, some fried scallops, and a shishito pepper.If you're in a party of two, expect to be sat alongside or across from strangers. It's a really nice experience!"", ""Best tempura I've had in my life! I love that their menu is just a couple things, because they can just do those couple of things really really well. The Definitely would advise coming early since there are about 8 seats total. (It's a quick meal, so things should move quickly, but nobody likes to wait :)The tempura don comes with shrimp, veggies, and an egg! The egg tempura was game-changing. Soft/runny on the inside and crisp on the outside. Another interesting thing that I hadn't had elsewhere was seaweed tempura. Worth a try if you're in the area and looking for something classic yet different.Also a great value for around $10!"", ""A MUST VISIT. Trust me. One of the most favorite dining experiences for me, especially coming from the US. You'd be surprised to realize how small the place is inside and that you'll most likely be sharing a table with a random person. Which is obviously unusual for us. My recommendation, come early. We arrive roughly 30 min before th he opened, and already had a good amount of people for their lunch rush. All food is made absolutely fresh. All ingredients are super delicate and light. Nothing too heavy or hard on the stomach. We tried other versions of this all through out japan, but this is the still the best establishment."", ""To be fair, this was my first tempura experience. But the bar is now set very high! We ventured with an open mind around 7pm on a Saturday anticipating a wait of the century. Lucky us, we only waited about 20 minutes! The menu is super limited and it's taken in line as you wait. I appreciate restaurants that have a small menu and create those dishes expertly. We were seated with another couple, which was fine by us. The more the merrier. Food was brought out within a matter of minutes. The tendon bowl was enormous! Each piece had a different flavor but I enjoyed it all. My favorite was the soft boiled egg. That gooey-goodness mixed with the rice was drool heaven. You'll be hard pressed to find a better tempura place for the same price (~$9)"", ""Worth the wait in hot or cold!What did I getThere was only one thing to get. The tempura bowl. This had everything in it, one of everything. There is egg, fish, shrimp, scallops (i think), and octopus... Not really sure, but everything that's on the menu as a side. This is fried in Sesame Oil and it was delicious! I love that it was still crunchy and not soggy. There were also some pickled ginger and radish for you to enjoy at the beginning. The ginger was AMAZINGEnvironmentVery very small location. Downstairs is more for single persons to eat, as it is at the counter and there is a handful of 4 seated tables upstairs. Big parties can get difficult.... I suggest not going during the peak hours. The peak hours are around lunch and I waited near to 2 hours to get inside.... Niceness of the staffLanguage barrier... Not much interactions. Was able to make my order and not have any issue... well yes there is only one thing to choose from. I would've liked if they told me that there is already an egg included and that I don't need to worry about that.DollarIt was super cheap! ¥1000 for the bowl of goodness! Yes?Yes yes yes! I have been here 2 times now! Despite the lines.... I am still returning!#WendyWanders"", ""I waited in a line almost 1 hour in this crazy humidity. It was worth it.Taste: Pretty sweet but tasty. I like their pickles too.Quantity: What?! Cheating?! The ball looks big but the bottom half is empty. You'll see how shallow.Price: Awesome! About $10 ¥1000!!!!Customer service: Good;) Water and fan and a bathroom outside. Tip: You should grab some drinks at Mitsukoshi department store or prefectural antenna shops before you wait in the queue.Parking lot: No.Location: Close to Mitsukoshi Hoten. 5 minutes walk."", ""Food: 4.0/5.0Service: 3.0/5.0Value: 4.0/5.0Decor: 2.5/5.0Overall: 4.0/5.0Very good tempura donburi. \xa0The line wasn't too bad on a Sunday late afternoon at roughly 30 minutes. \xa0There's really only one thing to get, namely the donburi with a bowl of miso soup. \xa0I'd have ordered another donburi but I guess that's not really a thing. \xa0Instead, I'd definitely come again."", 'Protip: Come around 5pm before the dinner rush and you\'ll be treated with probably the best tempura of your life. Neither my girlfriend nor I are huge fans of deep fried food, but I dragged her out here anyway since we heard great things about Kaneko Hannosuke. In fact, this place is so amazing that you can practically smell the deep fried batter while walking up to the restaurant.Kaneko was located in a small alleyway (as are a lot of restaurants in Tokyo), and we would\'ve struggled to find it if not for Google Maps. Since we arrived pretty early, we were able to secure a seat on the second floor. Note, this place gets packed FAST as it\'s small, so come early.Not many options to choose from, so you are pretty much limited to getting their set meal. It took around 15 minutes for the food to come, and OH BABY the portion size was huge! We got several gigantic pieces of tempura - included fish, shrimp, egg, and some veggies. Each one was perfectly crisp and very flavorful. Can\'t forget to mention that this was all over a huge bed of rice too. If you\'re in Tokyo and want to check out the best tempura, come to Kaneko. You won\'t regret it, even with a long wait. Your mind will be blown with the quality of the ingredients. I give it an ""Omg, I\'d travel 2 hours for this"" rating.Eat well and prosper,', ""Easily the best meal I've had in Tokyo! You'd be quite impressed seeing your bowl of tempura don (even though you've seen it in pictures before). It is a lot of food. They give you like a whole eel! Not just tiny cut up slices. There's also shrimp, squid/scallop mix, fish, okra, a half boiled egg (like they could really do that?!). Even the seaweed had tempura breading. Impressive! The tempura sauce is available at your table. The taste, the crunch, the seasoning - perfect!! As I was eating, I kept questioning how this meal could be less than 1000 yen. I don't understand how they do it. I still don't comprehend. But that makes it even better!! We arrived 10 mins post opening and there were already~ 15 people ahead of us. We waited approx 40 mins to get a seat. This tiny restaurant has 2 floors and maybe seats approx 15 people. You will most definitely be sharing a table with a stranger which is okay because everyone is just so focused on enjoying the good food. I cannot wait to go back!! Don't let the line stop you."", ""I waited in the rain for 2 hours; whilst I did so, I was What's App'ing peeps. Turns out LA does indeed have a tempura house with same name. I persevered.If so many locals can do it, ne'er a complaint did I hear ( through intonation), then doggoneit, I would just yknow..when in Rome.The bowls of ten'pura with rice (tendon) and the communal soup ( I shared my table with a Taiwanese lady, and we chatted politely over our lunch) was yummy!!For 1,070¥, I was stuffed to the gills and can honestly say that I have now tasted super tasty tempura. What a bargain! The batter could have been a wee bit crispier, but light and airy and perfectly cooked, it was.""]"
3,Harajuku Sakuratei,4.5,76,"['Just reminiscing on our Tokyo trip almost 3 years ago. This place is DIY okonomiyaki off the main streets of Harajuku and has a super cozy and quirky atmosphere. While you do grill for yourself, the ingredients and seasonings that are prepared for you are spectacular. Especially recommend trying out the monjayaki too!So filling and mouthwatering, definitely full of flavors to remember.', ""This place was a bit hard to fine as you have to go down this tight walkway that we missed a couple of times. \xa0There is a small sign that points however from looking at the walkway, you wouldn't think it was down that path. \xa0When you walk down that path, you have to walk passed some other shops so it doesn't look like it is the correct place but if you keep going and then turn left and walk a few steps, it is to your left. Once we found the place, they have spots inside and outside on their covered patio area. \xa0We chose the outside since we didn't want the smoky smell but then realized that we cook it ourselves. \xa0The patio is covered so most of the smoke stays there. \xa0It was a cool experience to make it as they do give you a small sheet of paper with instructions on how to make each dish. \xa0We made the okonomiyaki and the monjayaki. \xa0I just hope I did a good job making it and not ruin it. \xa0:)"", ""It's legit DIY okonomiyaki, you cook the entire meal yourself. It was so much fun and interactive and it tasted great. There are step by step directions how to make the food, just follow the instructions and you will be fine. The place will make your clothes smell but they do have plastic bags if you want to put your clothes away. Also, this place is so hidden, it is not on the main road so follow Google Maps.The food:Special Modern Yaki- Pork, shrimp, squid, yakisoba noddles, egg. I enjoyed the flavor and the texture of this was good, I enjoyed the yakisoba addition. I thought the bacon, shrimp and squid really added a nice flavor.

Okonomiyaki is a Japanese treasure, and this was my first time i got to make it myself- super fun.First, you choose the okonomiyaki you want. They have ones with traditional ingredients with seafood and meats, but they also have many types that are more unique like avocado/mushroom, etc. The ingredients arrive at your table and it's your turn to play chef. They hand you slips of paper with instructions on how to cook it, but it's really not that complicated. The hardest part was flipping the pancake!! Cooking was a lot of fun with friends :)I also want to mention that the inside of this place is super cool. it's got hipstery vibes with murals covering all the walls."", 'This place is slightly hidden but truly a gem! The food and service was amazing!!!

My family and I customized our orders and loved our first meal in Japan!We got the avocado Okonomiyaki and added garlic and shrimp.We got Yakisoba with pork. Would highly recommend this place!!!', ""TLDR; DIY okonomiyaki and monjayaki. They even have AYCE deals which seemed pretty worth it. There's some kind of fun in cooking your own food and that's exactly what you do at Sakuratei. Tables are set up like KBBQ places with metal racks of various seasonings and sauces to accompany your meal. Be careful and make sure the rack isn't too close to the grill. I didn't realize how close it was and burned myself while picking up the oil pot. My friends picked this place to cook their own okonomiyaki but I ordered the monjayaki since it was something new...I've never heard of it before coming to this restaurant. The way the menu described monjayaki was that it was a thicker consistency, almost like melted cheese. Sounded pretty intriguing! We also ordered dumplings and a squid, which you'll have to cook yourself. All you have to do is follow the directions and use your judgement. With monjayaki, there are some steps where you just have to eye it to figure out if you should move to the next step. Surprisingly, all of our dishes came out pretty good! I thought we would mess up somewhere since we had to cook it on our own. When you're done, pay at the cash register with card or cash. The only downside was the wait to be seated. It seemed like a lot of groups were leaving but they weren't seating anybody. When we were finally seated, we saw a lot of empty tables so I'm not sure why it took as long as it did. Other than that, I enjoyed my experience here!"", ""This hidden gem is tucked away on a back street and is a little off the main path. You can't find any obvious signs of it being an restaurant from the outside really but you'll know it from it's colorful art. I love the DIY okonomiyaki. You can choose what goes into it! It's a wonderful place to experience the build it and cook it yourself without having to buy a huge variety ingredients. Their instructions make it really easy to do and everything was quite tasty! They have handy storage for your bags and plastic covers that you can put over the storage or your outerwear. They really have thought of everything!Staff is friendly and helpful! It was quite a memorable experience to sit back, leisurely cook, sip a beer, and eat. Atmosphere is casual, trendy, and hip. I almost felt like I was too old to be out with this cool crowd."", ""Really fun DIY okonomoyaki place! I still think it tastes better when someone else cooks it for you (although a plus here is that you can control how much sauce/salt/seasoning to put on), but if you want to have some fun with friends then this is the place to go. It gets really smoky inside, so you'll definitely leave smelling a bit like grilled meat. They have a few vegetarian options, and there's an English menu. Definitely a lot of tourists here, they push themselves pretty hard on TripAdvisorThere's two entrances (the front is quite easy to miss) but there's a nice small art gallery of sorts attached to the restaurant which is fun to look through."", ""Okonomyaki. Do it yourself. Does this actually work? YES. Really fun place that is very chill and filled with gaijin. Ok, my finished product looks even worse than the other pics on here. But I don't think it's fair that I can be judged on how well I make something that I can't even pronounce. Looks aside, we got two okonomiyakis (a Teletubby should be named this), one with meat and the other seafood. Both were yummy and very filling. Tack on an ice cold beer with that and what do you have? A perfect lunch in the Shinjuku/Harajuku area."", ""The place is kinda hard to find but once you are in, it's quite spacious.

If I ever get back to Tokyo I will look for this place again.', ""We've been to Jirōmaru at least 4 times over the past few years. \xa0I mean, this is ALWAYS a stop for us when we're in Shinjuku. \xa0It's super small, and it's a stand up yakiniku spot. \xa0Each time we had the staff choose our cuts. \xa0They ask how hungry you are, and most times we'll add veggies or another few cuts if we're feeling like it. \xa0But just really leave the selection up to them (unless you can read Japanese). \xa0The grades of the meats are noted on the wooden signs with the prices and most times they have A5. \xa0You also need to order a drink - orange juice, beer, sake... \xa0Also they have some dipping sauces available above the counter with salt. \xa0I generally like their bbq sauce, it's soy based. \xa0They also hand you an apron, use it as you wish. \xa0Be forewarned, you will smell like bbq, but that's the price you have to pay for deliciousness. \xa0Oishii!!!!"", ""What an awesome experience: standing room only yakiniku in the middle of Shinjuku.This place is hard to find, so make sure to look at the photos posted on yelp to match up the door/sign. Once you get there, you'll have to line up for a spot as there's only space for about 8-10 ppl. It's extremely tiny and hot inside, but worth the wait for this experience and quality of food. There's one door for a narrow corridor for guests and one door for another narrow corridor for the chefs. There is no menu in English, but the chef's are accommodating. Just ask for the chefs special menu and they'll ask you about your hunger level to determine how many pieces you get. Leave it up to them to choose, they know best. I recommend you go with light to medium hungry, then you can top up on the pieces you love from that set if you have room for more. They have high quality wagyu beef that is buttery soft and delicious, so you'll definitely be making room for more! \xa0You won't even mind the heat or standing, it's THAT good. On top of the beef, you'll have to order a drink and theres the option of veggies & rice too.You won't find this anywhere else in the world but Tokyo, both the experience and the quality of beef. This is a must try when you're in Shinjuku!"", ""Let me start by saying that this place is bomb. \xa0It is Bomb dot com. \xa0I've had true Kobe Wagyu beef here in Japan before at several different places and even at its birthplace in Kobe, Japan itself so I feel like I know a little about the quality of this beef. \xa0Each time it has been excellent yet expensive. \xa0Here at Jiromaru, you can experience Kobe Wagyu beef at a discounted price as it is sold by each piece so you can sample several styles of cuts at reasonable rates. \xa0A5 quality is the top prime quality followed by A4. \xa0The marbling on any of the cuts here are amazing. \xa0You really can't go wrong with any cut. \xa0I wish I knew which cuts were what. \xa0I let the chef decide which ones for me. \xa0I did order more after his recommended cuts. \xa0I think I tried the majority of cuts of Wagyu beef and liked them all however I do prefer the thicker cuts that were provided. \xa0Sorry can't even say which cuts or which numbers they were. \xa0I do know that one of the A5 cuts were too marbled and it tasted like pure fat. \xa0I actually preferred more of the A4 cuts than A5. \xa0I was instructed to cook the beef down the middle of the grill otherwise the sides of the grill will burn the meat. \xa0After a while I started to put the meat closer to the sides as I like the beef charred some. \xa0I got a plate of veggies and bowl of rice and some drink to accompany my beef. \xa0Cook your meat how you like and enjoy. There are no menus in English and my basic Japanese doesn't go too far but the chef had some basic English to help. \xa0There was a couple next to me that was from Cali also and they helped me too. \xa0This yakiniku style joint is a standing-only place with no seats and maybe 6-7 grills. \xa0There are hooks under the counter to put your bags and jackets. \xa0There were dipping sauces, miso and plain salt n pepper. \xa0Sauces were so good. \xa0I went on a weekday shortly after it opened as there was no wait. \xa0My total bill was about $34 and was well worth it. \xa0I def will go back next time."", ""AMAZING EXPERIENCE !!We came here around 3PM. Our meal times were off due to jet lag but we ended up being the only ones in the restaurant which was really fun! We got the butchers all to ourselves.2 people share 1 grill as well as the sauces. The let the chef pick ~6 cuts for us. Most were A4/A5 cuts. You grill it yourself so you can pick how rare or we'll done you'd like your meat. They were delicious and tasted great with the sauces!! My favorite was the beef shoulder. It melted in my mouth and was seriously like nothing I've had before!! We also ordered pork belly + beef tongue in addition to what the chef gave us.We had a great experience! The worker spoke a good about of English so it was easy!"", ""I got to try 6 different types of A4 and A5 wagyu beef and it did not disappoint! The interior is standing room only and only about 7 or 8 people can be at the counter at one time, but I was lucky enough to go at an off peak hour when there was only one other customer eating. I'm honestly not sure what the exact cuts of beef are called since there was no real menu (just a bunch of signs hanging from a wall) and everything was in Japanese. I just asked the chef to choose for us and they were all delicious. Some of them were a little more tender than others, but overall it was a great experience cooking the beef ourselves and getting to try some premium wagyu."", ""I was a bit hesitant to come here since I saw a lot of mixed reviews on google about this but phenomenal reviews on yelp about this place. First of all, this is a standing wagyu eating place. I didn't have to wait on line fortunately but it is very small in this restaurant. You can really only allow 8-10 people max at a time. Many people stated on google reviews that the workers here charge you extra because everything is in japanese and sometimes you lose count of how many slices you actually ordered. I've also heard of people saying that they were served lower grade wagyu meat since they didn't know any better.However, I still came in to try this place out. I didn't get charged the wrong amount of pieces, because i went with the chef's special that came with 6 slices. He told me what cuts they were before handing it to me. However, since his english wasn't great, I couldn't really understand him and I didn't want to keep pressing about it. I can tell you that the first 3 pieces tasted amazing - melts in your mouth type of beef, the last 3 pieces were pretty mediocre. I didn't know what I was eating but the texture wasn't the same at all. I don't know if the meat I ordered was swapped or if that's just how it tastes since he did give me different cuts from the menu, but I was a little dismayed that half my course wasn't good. (That's one of the reasons I knocked off a star)I also ordered some veggies (mushrooms) on the side, rice and a beer. The total was about $30 USD I think so it wasn't horrible, but yes when you think of the fact that this came from 6 thinly sliced beef that are supposed to be 200-300 yen per piece, it does kinda seem a little pricey. Anyway, I think this place is best if you come with someone who knows Japanese and what kind of cuts to get. It's really not that tourist friendly which is understandable- not everything has to be catered to us. It was good for the experience, but I'd much prefer to come back again with someone familiar with Japanese."", 'This was probably my favorite meal in Tokyo. I loved the service, the food and the overall experience. So my friends actually tried to come the night before but it was so packed that they ate next door. They tried again and this time with us and we were the 2nd group in line. Do not expect anything fancy. This is a standing restaurant and you grill you own food. I think the place literally ""stands"" 10 people. It is also really cramped so if you are claustrophobic stay away from this spot... but you will be missing out.There is no English menu, but the staff does speak some English. We basically told them to give us what they recommended. Each cut is about $3 and they explain to you which part of the cow it is and whether its A4 or A5. All the cuts were incredible. I love how you get different parts of the cow so you can really taste the difference in flavor and texture. Highly recommended.', ""Amazing Japanese bbq experience! Be warned, it's very small inside and you have to stand up while eating but it's all part of the experience""]"

This is strictly counter-service, with not a seat in sight. Staff will direct you to a spot at the counter and drop off a mug of steaming green tea. Order with the chef, enjoy your meal, get your bill, and settle up. I nabbed two pieces of salmon, two pieces of tuna, and a piece of mackerel.

But the staff are so accommodating letting you know when you can enter as people are leaving. The process was easy, just let the chef closest to you know you want to order and next thing you know delicious sushi is placed on your banana leaf. Each piece I ate was delicious I ended up dancing in my standing place . All tiredness was forgotten as my tastebuds were in sushi la la land. What was also awesome about this place was the pricing. About USD $2 for 2 pieces nigiri!!! My man and I had a feast altogether for less than $25 USD. Definitely recommend coming to this spot if you're in Tokyo!!"", 'Such a great hidden treasure in Shinjuku that is quintessential of what you\'d expect a standing sushi bar should be: small and standing while you\'re eating, personal sushi chef in front of you, every nigiri made in front of you, and you\'re in and out within 30 mins. It\'s easy to miss this place because the giant sign outside is in Japanese, but underneath it says ""standing sushi bar"", which helps foreigners find it. The inside will be packed, but just wait 30 mins or so and your turn will come up.Upon entering, \xa0you\'re assigned a spot to stand in front of a sushi chef.

You can also point to the picture and they\'ll understand what you want. Each nigiri was between 324 to 540 yen (around $2.85 to $4.85) for two pieces. I ordered: salmon, toro salmon, toro tuna, scallops, uni, crab innards, and white fish.After the sushi chef made it, he placed it on the green leaf in front of me. The best ones were uni, crab innards, salmon and tuna toro. The uni was fresh and creamy because I could still see the texture of the sea urchin. The bite was o so perfect. The crab innards were delicious because it was the crab tomalley that you\'d see in the crab shell. Not many people ordered it, but it was very creamy and smooth when I ate it. It tasted fresh and was exactly like eating crab. The salmon/tuna toros were delicious because of the soft texture and buttery taste. There\'s also hot green tea to wash your palette between nigiri.Definitely a place to stop by for a quick dinner if you\'re looking for a traditional standing sushi bar.', 'Tip: come after prime hoursAmazing sushi and great prices as well.

6,Karashibi Miso Ramen Kikanbo,4.5,116,"[""I have made no secret of my deep and undying love of both ramen and Japanese curry during my stay here on Yelp. I had the pleasure of living in Japan for quite some time, and during that stay I indulged in a lot of ramen and curry. Unfortunately for me, I didn't discover this joint until I came back for a visit nearly 3 years after returning to the US. What a shame, too, because I think this is my favorite ramen joint in the region. And it really isn't even all that close.This place gets BUSY. We came here for lunch on a weekday during rainy season. There was a line of about 14 \xa0people out the door, holding umbrellas, waiting to place their order at the vending machine. People turn out for this place. And they really should. I don't recall if the vending machine has English names or not, but I am pretty sure that it is friendly to a variety of languages besides Japanese, so no need to worry about that. Once you get your ticket and get inside, it really feels a bit like you are stepping into an underground hardcore show. It is dark and crowded and loud, like a small SF dive bar. Totally my type of scene.The main appeal of this place is the spice. They hang their hat on their extremely spicy bowls of ramen, \xa0and they really should. We got the second hottest pepper bowl (not the one with the demon face, which made me think I would soon be joining my ancestors in the afterlife if I ordered it) and took our seats at the counter. Service is super quick. You can tell that there is an emphasis on expediency. I felt like we had our ramen before I had finished hanging our coats.The ramen here is mind blowing. It is one of the thickest, richest, tastiest broths that I have ever had in my life. Oh, and spiciest. I would probably dial the heat down a little bit next time. I think that my tolerance for spicy food is high, but I also believe that at a certain point it takes something away from the flavor. That said, even with the high heat, this was still an absolutely quality bowl of ramen. I am disappointed that I cannot find anything quite as rich and spicy as this, even here in the Bay Area.This is an A++ experience. An authentic Japanese ramen outing if ever there was one. Stand in a long line that moves pretty quick, order from a machine, take your ticket and have a seat at the counter. Eat your noodles quickly and be on your way. It is fast and efficient. It is tasty and indulgent. It is everything that I want when I go out for soup on a cold, rainy day. I cannot wait to come back here again. If you get the chance, you absolutely need to eat here."", ""I've been to Japan twice and I've been to this restaurant at least 5 times.Such a delicious, rich, melt in your mouth bowl of ramen.I love this place so much that three years later I still dream about it and one day hope that I can franchise it and bring it to the states.It's definitely not for the weak hearted. You must go hungry and ready for flavor because is definitely a meal.The chefs are friendly and exciting. The decor is awesome and eclectic. The beating drums in the background becon you to keep eating. Wash it down with a delicious local Yebisu cold beer. Thank me later!"", ""This is my first review for Japan because it was one of my top meals there. If you are in Akihabara to explore the city of anime, manga, games, & toy figurines, you must must MUST go to Karashibi Miso Ramen Kikanbo. It's about a 10-15 minute walk from the main attractions of Akihabara. We arrived at 6pm on a weekday, and there was already a short line forming. Remember to pay at the vending machine first to get a ticket before getting in line. Needless to say, the line quickly started getting longer and longer as we were waiting. Their main kitchen was across the street. As for the ramen, I had the regular ramen with egg. They have two types of spices (chili pepper and sansho pepper). I opted for less spice by getting a regular ramen with egg, less spicy chili pepper, and less spicy sansho pepper. You can choose the spice for a range of (none, less, medium, or high). Being acquainted to eating spicy food, I could probably have handled a medium. The broth was sooooooo rich. I can still taste the strong garlic flavor just thinking about it. The spices have a numbing effect in the back of the throat. Everyone was seated at the ramen bar. They have self-serve water and bibs provided at the table to anticipate that slurping. The server who guides you to your seat can speak English, Chinese, Japanese, and who knows what other languages he was well-versed in. Oh boy, do they play fast music to get you in & out. Hands down to one of the best ramen places!!!"", ""Very good ramen shop if you like super thick, spicy, and rich broths. I personally prefer a lighter broth, but I really appreciated the variety of toppings! The pork slices are definitely the highlight for me. Thick cut, nicely marinated, and amazingly tender.Another unique aspect is that they have two different spice levels. One is a more typical chili pepper, and the other is a sansho pepper which is more citrusy. The levels range from no spice all the way up to oni-level. I generally don't like my hot soups very spicy so I went with low spice and it was the perfect level for me.There's usually a line to eat at this place. You have to pay in advance at the ticket machine outside so the line moves quicker than you'd expect."", 'The ramen at Kikanbo is legendary. The pork, the variety of how spice and pepper is used, the noodles and the overall satisfaction is top notch. A very unique and spicy experience I would recommend to any ramen enthusiast.', ""Very impressive ramen! There are two storefronts, one is not for ramen. I got a bit confused while approaching here. I came here for an early dinner on a weekday and didn't wait to get a seat at all, but while I was leaving, there were probably 10 people waiting outside. Looks like they just get off work. I got the premium ramen, and the taste and volume are both excellent. It's a giant bowl and I was so stuffed afterward, but it's well worth it! You can choose what kind of spicy you want, and how much for each kind. Highly recommended this place, it's one of these places you will remember even if you only came once."", ""There are many different styles of ramen served in Japan, and spicy flavors are pretty rare. Kikanbo seriously brings the heat and it's appropriately devil themed. All the decor, including in the bathroom, are devilish. You order at the vending machine outside, and there's a decent amount of English to help you along. Go with the premium size to get extra delicious pork belly! \xa0You can choose between chili pepper or sancho pepper, and there's 5 levels of heat for each starting from none to maximum oni level. My husband and I both got the medium chili level which was already sweat inducing. A guy next to us got the oni level and was dying - the waiter said it's the first he's seen someone eat oni in 2 years. The noodles and pork belly were cooked to perfection, and combined with the spice was truly amazing! Would not hesitate to return."", ""Best ramen I have ever had in my life so far.

Lol"", ""I've been in Tokyo for a couple months now. Ive had a ton of ramen, and this has been my favorite ramen place so far! This place is pretty straightforward.

You enter this place and feel like you're about to go to war with some battle music playing in the background. Not widely inaccurate... this ramen is intense. They specialize in spicy miso ramen here. You are able to pick your levels of red spice and black spice. (they even sell their spice mixture for you to take home) I got level one because i'm a total baby and you could definitely feel it! I think next time, i'll go up one level, but no more. The place doesn't mess around and 10 is reserved for those who are truly insane. Super recommended. right off of kanda station. The wait also went really fast during lunch."", ""The ramen broth is quite rich. I liked the chewiness of the noodles. The meat chunks were incredibly fatty and I thought the egg was decent. Overall a solid bowl of ramen. I thought the numbing part was nice and I probably should have specified more for that.However I didn't realize that the premium ramen was like half bean sprouts. I hate bean sprouts and can't stand them in my ramen so I spent a lot of time taking them out. I think next time I'll order something else or ask them to hold.""]"

Flavor maybe too strong for some but it is just right for my taste. It is so flavorful and texture of noodle is right at my alley. It\'s somewhat close to eating spaghetti which requires some stirring before you eat. But the flavor is nowhere near spaghetti sauce. It\'s more towards ramen flavor.I think this still suits well for people who aren\'t food adventurous.Most of dish are ¥1000 and less.Check it out!!']"

It does fill up quickly as it is a smaller space but the staff is good and very good with accommodating English speakers. The interior is so cute and very modern.

On each table is a one-sheet detailing how they make their pancakes (in-house, by-hand) and why it takes ~25 minutes to come to your table. While it was a tortuous wait, it was well worth it.Seldom do pics and videos do justice to a food, but I think the photos uploaded here on Yelp truly capture the essence of these happy pancakes: brilliantly airy and light! The trio paired perfectly with the simmered down berry compote, light whipped cream, and vanilla ice cream. Be forewarned that you can really taste the egg used in the batter, which could probably be toned down a bit in my opinion.I wanted to revisit Happy Pancake before we left the country, but couldn't afford the wait time on our short trip.

More cylinder like than anything. \xa0It's a decent size spot but the wait area itself is pretty small. We came in the afternoon around 130pm so didn't have to wait long at all. We ordered the banana and chocolate sauce and mixed season fruit both with vanilla ice cream. Even the vanilla bean ice cream is top quality stuff.

I also love the interior of this place, and the big glass wall looking into the kitchen where you can see the chefs flipping the jiggly pancakes.

Once you find it, take the elevator up and check in via the tablet to get a number. The kitchen is in full display so you can see them make the pancakes which I thought was cool. The menus are simple and they have pictures! For your very first one, I recommend trying their most naked pancake that comes with the honey and whipped cream. Experiencing their pancakes at its purest form is a treat. Though the dish might be simple, it really lets each component shine. The whipped cream is rich and airy, the honey is perfectly sweet, and the pancakes are pillows of perfection. I found the other dishes like the milk tea pancakes just too much though it was good. You can have these treats anytime a day! For me, it seems more like dessert than breakfast but starting the day with these pancakes would definitely make my day."", 'Thick, fluffy and sweet.

The restaurant was located away from the main streets and we even got lost while looking for it. The decor was modern with an open kitchen set up and the ambience was elegant. Their service was really authentic Japanese, polite and considerate. The options on the menu were various and we had a hard time making up our decisions. We ordered a classic pork chop set and a sashimi & pork chop combination. Their fried pork chop was super juicy inside with crispy & chunky layer. The best way to enjoy is dipping in the special sauce with white radish purée. The sashimi was okay but not special so we highly recommend to have their signature fried pork chop set.', ""Oh my goodness, this is a must try. Absolutely the best, most tender, most crispy, most flavorful tonkatsu I've ever had. Truly recommend this for anyone who visits Tokyo. It is on the pricier side especially for getting the premium kurobuta pork but it is so worth it."", 'One of the best pork katsu I have ever eaten in Tokyo is at this location. I come eat here every time I visit Tokyo which is quite often. Service is fast and the staff are always friendly. Food is always on par and super delicious! They also have lunch specials. Not very expensive especially for the quality. I love this place & wish they opened one in NYC!', 'Decently affordable tonkatsu and options for non pork eaters like myself!Why come? The panko crumb at this place is AahhHmazzing. Touristy and not your typical hole in wall, but worth making a stop for if you want the diverse menu options The food;- SO enjoyed tonkatsu- salt salmon and shrimp tonkatsu are great for seafood lovers - Pass on cucumber crab salad - doused in mayo, not flavorfulTLDR: authentic but not ultra local kind of authentic. Good for non pork eaters', 'Best tonkatsu ever eaten. The pork so juicy and complement with the sauce. Will come back again for sure.', ""Omg, this place was so good we ate here 4 times during our 12 days in Japan! Luckily this place is a chain so we we're able to vary it up a bit by eating at different locations. \xa0Lol. \xa0So far, my favorite location is the one at Omotesando. \xa0The atmosphere is much more fancy compared to the Shibuya train station and the Osaka location. \xa0Also, the Omotesando location was the only place that served unlimited COLD tea. \xa0The other locations only gave hot tea. Other than that, the taste was exactly the same. The kids and I ordered the tonkatsu plate with curry. I have never had tonkatsu that light, crispy, moist and tender before. Nothing else compares to this place. My husband had the Tonkatsu Don. That was good too. \xa0I ordered that during one of our visits. The rice, shredded cabbage and soup is all you can eat. If you are in Japan and are craving Tonkatsu you have to give this place a try."", ""After walking around Omotesando for a while, we needed to find a spot for dinner and Tonkatsu came to mind. We landed at Maisen, which is a famous Tonkatsu chain in Japan.Definitely the most PREMIUM Tonkatsu I've ever had the pleasure of sinking my teeth into!Kurobuta (Black Pig) Loin Pork Cutlet Set 3,100¥We also tried the to-go shop on the way out. 1 set (~600¥) comes with 3 pieces. Pretty tasty but doesn't compare to the real deal we just devoured."", ""The best tonkatsu that I have had in my life! This was an awesome reward after 24+ hour journey to get to Japan.There are options of different types of pork, which if your a connoisseur or pork aficionado, you would definitely appreciate. The menu is in English, but the waitstaff's English is limited, so you probably won't get too many explanations beyond what is in the menu. I got curry sauce with my pork, and it was delicious. Writing this review and thinking about this meal is actually causing me to drool. A must hit spot, if you're looking for tonkatsu."", 'This is my favorite katsu place to go to whenever I am in Tokyo. This is one of the best pork katsu I have eaten so far. Food is always consistently delicious & they have very good lunch specials. Service is always fast and exceptional & staff are always so friendly. Highly recommended!', ""This was our first meal in Tokyo and it was delicious! Don't be intimidated by the line because it moves relatively fast. We had five people in our party and it wasn't a long wait at all! We got to sit upstairs on the tatami mats too -- getting the whole traditional feel. But some of my friends, who were taller, had some issues sitting for a long period of time. So if you're someone who can't sit on the ground to eat then ask for a table instead. My husband and I shared a benibuto tonkatsu dish and their specialty, the tonkatsu sandwich!Both were so delicious! The sandwich had their special sauce in it and it was perfection. The bread was soft and the tonkatsu was so juicy! \xa0The price isn't bad either! Definitely a place to try if you want some tonkatsu. They are popular for a reason! :)""]"

The wait wasn't too bad about 30 minutes (10 people in front of us). The decor of MISOJYU is arty and adorable with industrial plain wall. The ambiance is cozy and passionate because of friendly service. Choose 1 soup and 1 rice balls for their regular set, we had Chunky Vege & Pork Tonjiru set with spicy tuna rice ball (¥1,380) and White Miso Soy & Scallop Potage with grilled salmon rice ball (¥1,380).Everything is astonishingly amazingly, especially the white miso soy & scallop potage, delicious, thick and rich but not greasy at all. There was a great amount of ingredients with variety braised in the soup as a healthy and light set. We also love their plain tofu, one of side in the set, the best tofu I have ever had in my life, super soft and creamy. You can tell from all the details in your set how much the chef and staff care about & proud of their food. If you are a tourist and get tired of all the heavy food during traveling, MISOJYU is definitely the best choice to take a rest for your stomach."", ""This is such a cool breakfast or bunch spot that was a few blocks from my hotel and a couple blocks from Sensoji Temple. \xa0I got there shortly after it opened and there already was a line. \xa0I didn't want to wait so I made a to-go order. \xa0I ordered their breakfast special which was a miso mushroom soup with one onigiri. \xa0The miso soup included mushrooms, turnips and cabbage. \xa0I chose the ume-onigiri which is the pickled plum one. \xa0You get the soup and rice ball for ¥600+ tax. \xa0The soup was good and simple. \xa0I thought the onigiri was smaller than normal size and was not pressed together enough and it was somewhat falling apart. \xa0My meal was light and simple but lacked some 'Wow' factor to it. \xa0Dining in looks to be a better experience as the place is decorated modern and cool. \xa0Wish I had time to dine there."", ""Misojyu serves up some delicious miso soup and onigiri rice balls. The staff is super nice, welcoming, and accommodating even during peak service times. Each bowl of miso is carefully prepared with the finest ingredients available.

The 'setto' (set meal) is the way to go if you're feeling a bit more fammishe from all that Tokyo exploration.I've eaten at Misojyu a few times, both in the little seating area on the 1st floor, and the cozy and beautifully decorated upstairs dining room, and have enjoy the meal every time. The staff, especially Kaho (sp.?), is always taking the time to explain the ingredients and where they're from. I think she just wants to practice her sweet English that she learnt while studying in Reno, Nevada! Please drop in when in Asakusa and you won't be disappointed."", ""We managed to come across this cute little restaurant while strolling around the streets of Asakusa in Tokyo looking for breakfast spot. The shop opens at 8:30am; we arrived around 9am and there was already a line up! We waited close to 30 minutes to get a seat since it's a pretty small place. The first floor only has seats for about 8 people and the 2nd floor has some larger tables meant for sharing.Everything on their menu is apparently organic and it definitely tastes like high quality stuff! Really great atmosphere too. It would be a cool place to chill out if it were bigger and had more seats. Otherwise, it's a great place to sit down and grab a traditional Japanese breakfast. They do take out as well if you're in a rush though!Their breakfast sets include a bowl of miso soup, an onigiri rice ball, and green tea for only about 700 yen! They have a good selection of onigiri: shio (salted with seaweed), ume (pickled plum), genmai (brown rice), shake (salmon flakes), spicy tuna. I went for the ume and my mom got the genmai. Both were delicious! Our miso soups were yummy and comforting as well. One of them was full of mushrooms and the other had huge chunks of tofu.If you go for lunch, you have more options of miso soup to choose from and they look more filling as well. The lunch sets also include 2 side dishes, although they're more expensive at around 1300 yen? Still worth it though I'd say! If I'm ever in the area again, I'd love to go back and try their lunch set!"", ""Fantastic little restaurant perfect for breakfast or lunch. We stopped in here after strolling through the market to sit down for a meal. The lunch set is the perfect amount of food: not too filling or overbearing.The lunch set comes with your choice of soup, half an egg, some chicken, tofu, veggies, your choice of an onigiri, and a refreshing cup of iced green tea.The mushroom miso soup is full of flavor and several different types of mushrooms. The side dishes were a nice compliment to its robust flavor.The staff here was very friendly. Don't forget to check out the art upstairs. This is a great and super affordable lunch option."", ""Such a great spot to get a taste of something more traditional for breakfast!

This would be worth a 40 minute commute to me.', ""Holy tastiness! Yummm. On my last day in Japan I found this place - I got lost but worth the wandering. For under $7, I had a breakfast of soup that included eggplant chunks and seaweed, a pickled plum rice ball and cold green tea. I'm not the most adventurous eater, so I was a bit concerned, but while. I wish I could eat here every day. You won't be disappointed. The food is amazing and the tables upstairs are very nice. Make sure you stop by this gem."", ""Very tasty soups with organic ingredients! No overpowering flavors as often found in for example ramen restaurants. We enjoyed the soup with tofu very much! The tiny side dishes in the set menu are also tasty. The style of the restaurant is somewhat a mix of traditional and modern with many of wooden elements - even the spoons and chopsticks as you can see on some photos. At least one staff member spoke English very well and they have an English menu. We absolutely recommend visiting if you're looking for a nice breakfast or lunch! We came here the day after our first night in Japan and are very happy with our decision. A great start to our holidays!"", 'Great traditional food with organic ingredients.

We strongly recommend ordering the chunky bacon slice in the photo. It is the one thing we ordered twice. The butcher's rib and lamb meat are also excellent. The lamb is quite mild in lamb taste, which is nice for those who may otherwise have an aversion. We arrived both times without a reservation and they were happy to sit us at the bar after a short wait. Highly recommend for those who love meat. As part of the service, your meat is flame-grilled over coals and brought to you atop crispy fries, with a side of mustard, and grilled tomatoes. They then present your dish before asking if you'd like it sliced before you. Say yes! They then replate your steak and pile on the juices. This adds extra flavor to both your meat and fries."", ""Unbelievably good deal. $9 for lunch, which included soup, salad, steak, a piece of chicken, rice, and french fries.

There are printed menus as well. You can pay by cash or card. Staff were lovely. It took a little while to receive my order but the place was busy and it was well worth the wait.

I highly recommend this."", 'So this is my 2nd time coming here and I love this place! This restaurant is on the 6th floor and as soon as you walk in you will see the fridge where they keep their meat and age their meats. There is a 600 yen fee per person but you get vegetables and a really delicious house dip!! And its not like you have to tip here so might as well pay the 600 fee. My favorites here are the 20 day aged beef and the rare beef fillet which MELTS in your mouth. I did notice that they cut with the grain instead of against but apparently that doesnt matter here because the meat melts and isnt not tough at all. I felt like I didnt even have to chew. I was just mashing the meat against my mouth because it was so soft!!! Also I love the fries. They are fried perfectly and topped with a cream which is soooo creamy and savory and rich!!! Its like a sour cream and onion whip cream. The staff here is also really nice and if you get lucky there is a staff member there who speaks english which is a really nice lady who use to live in New Jersey. The other staff members also will talk with you and ask where you are from which is super nice. As you leave they will wait with you as the elevator comes back and they will bow as you leave. Come check this place out!! Its on the main strip of akihabara on the 6th floor. Super amazing food and staff.', ""Stumbled across this little gem while walking down the street in Akihabara. The staff are incredibly patient and friendly. Now to the the food. If I could give this place more than the 5 allotted, I would.

They were very friendly, but incredibly inattentive and it seemed like there were only 3-4 waitresses servicing the entirely full tea room.. this made it incredibly hard to ask for our check after the food/tea was served. There were a couple other tables with rich looking patrons that seemed like they were demanding a fair bit of attention (but I'd almost expect that in a Shangri-La hotel).We came here for afternoon tea on a whim, during a weekday. The tea was good, not the best I've had (but I'm also comparing that to London) but certainly did not disappoint for a high profile hotel. The hotel has panoramic views and the bathrooms are absolutely beautiful (they deserve a special mention). The tea was good and I wish I could've tried more types of it, but I was a little too overly caffeinated and hydrated by the second pot. It was hard to choose because there were quite a few different hotels that had afternoon tea. I'm not sure I'd come here again simply because it didn't blow my mind, and it seems like there's a handful of other amazingly rated afternoon teas in Tokyo that I'd rather try first before making a return visit."", ""An alluring lounge offering you a cozy place to relax and unwind after a day of sight seeing and adventuring. \xa0Located near the Tokyo Station it's not far from all the surrounding hotels.

17,Marugo,4.5,51,"[""Visited: Dec 1, 2018We were prepared to wait and we were not disappointed - a healthy 90 minute wait to get inside and another 20-30 minutes for the food to arrive. \xa0It was a Saturday and dinner time so enough said.The quality of the pork and prawns that we ordered was out of this world. \xa0The pork melts in your mouth and the prawn tastes so fresh it was sublime. \xa0With the combo, we get 1 refill of rice and salad. \xa0There were pickled vegetables (3 types if I remembered correctly) and they were tasty and great condiments to your rice. \xa0The red miso soup was interesting - a tad salty so that wasn't my favourite.The service was attentive, they don't speak English but understand if you just want more tea or refills of the rice and salad.We sat with another couple and they ordered 4 entrees and thought they were crazy. \xa0In the end, we wished we did the same as we were still hungry afterwards. \xa0The meat portions are not as large as we'd like to be.Ordered: \xa0Breaded Pork Medallion Cutlet SetBreaded Prawns Set"", ""Out of all the tonkatsu places, Marugo is probably the best quality tonkatsu I ever had. I got the pork medallion set meal, which comes with red miso soup, salad, pickled cucumbers and rice. The meat quality stood out as it is super tender and juicy. The miso soup is a little different, as it is much denser and richer in flavor. The katsu sauce is on the table, so you would pour to your tasting. My only complaint is that the bottom of the tonkatsu got soggy due to the oil soaking onto the paper sheet. I guess I'm just Americanized where I care more about well rounded rather than the meat. Came here on a weekday ~30mins before opening. There was already a long line waiting, and overall I waited about 1 hour before getting seated. They're not the most efficient when it comes seating people, but I liked it that way (Rather then stuffing as many people as they can in one small enclosed area) They are somewhat foreigner friendly, with English menu available that is descriptive about the place and what they serve (Unlike the other places where its just pictures) It is a little on the pricier side for food in Japan but still average priced in comparison to food in USA. Overall, I would recommend this place to other but as a tourist, I probably would not come back here again."", 'Pretty decent tonkatsu but having tried many other places, I really couldn\'t tell why this was better or why it was Michelin Bib Gourmand worthy. I mean don\'t get me wrong it was really good and much better than your average tonkatsu but it made me wonder ...Waited in line for dinner at this two story shop. The wait was long so fortunately there were no weather issues, but I could imagine if it were in the heat of summer or biting cold of winter. They seem to serve a limited amount of pork katsu each day because whilst waiting in line, someone would come out periodically and did a head count. Eventually, he came out with a sign and placed it in the back of the line indicating that they were sold out. We went with both the premium pork medalion cutlet and premium pork loin cutlet. Not sure what makes it a premium over the other ""regular"" of the same cuts. Perhaps it was more fatty? Our cutlets were a bit more fatty than the many other tonkatsu places we\'ve enjoyed around Japan, so maybe that\'s what makes it ""premium""? I suppose you could just enjoy the katsu by itself but you\'ll need to fork out another few bucks, I mean Yen, more for a ""set meal"" of miso soup and endless bowls of rice. There was abit of a wait for the dishes because the place was completely packed. It was almost torture watching the people around us enjoy their food as we just sat there waiting. I suppose one can nibble at the complimentary pickled scallions or omeboshi -- pucker up those lips. Overall, a great place and better than than your average tonkatsu restaurant, so a recommendation is in order to give it a try!', ""No doubt this is one of the best to katsu place ever. The meat is so perfectly crusted and it doesn't feel oily. The shrimps are huge and tender. You can add as much sauce as you want and eat as much marinated scallions also. We tried the side dishes: the red miso soup has a nice taste but was a bit too salty. The pork stew came in a cold jelly and was delicious with the mustard. The beef tongue was very tender and flavorful. Everything was so good. The service was quick and the staff was super friendly. They speak relatively good english and it's easy to communicate. The place had a nice ambiance and is located near the center of akihabara. This place is a must if you visit tokyo."", ""Definitely worth the wait based off the food alone. Waited about 30 minutes at 12:45 pm on a Thursday afternoon with about 12-15 ppl in line. 2 levels inside with upstairs for groups and downstairs for diners at the bar. Everything from the food to the condiments and service were great. I can easily see why Marugo was named on Tokyo's Michelin guide. Quite easily the best tonkatsu that I've had. Pork was very very moist and didn't really need the sauce but the sauce only enhanced the flavors. The breading was super flakey/light on the premium medallion cutlet at $2,100 yen and extra 450 for the set that includes rice, miso soup and cabbage salad. Very reasonable prices for the quality of food and taste. I would definitely come back when I re-visit Tokyo."", 'It\'s only fitting to have eaten the best tonkatsu in Japan, or anything Japanese for that matter. Featured in Tokyo\'s Michelin Guide 2016, Takayoshi Takeuchi\'s mastery of the ""low temperature frying"" technique has garnered quite the followers Marugo has to date, both locals and tourists. Now, don\'t let the line outside deter you because I promise you the wait is worthwhile.I say go with the Set Menu, that\'s what we did. It includes a bowl of rice, red miso soup, and pickles. And if you want a second bowl of rice or extra cabbage, just say - ""Okawari kudasai!""TONKATSU (¥2,100) -- I got the pork medallions vs. the pork loin cutlet as I wanted the convenience of eating each piece dipped in different sauces (tonkatsu sauce, no sauce, or just a squirt of lemon and some salt). If you ask what I prefer, it\'s hard to pick. I enjoyed them all individually because the fact of the matter is, the tonkatsu itself is golden - literally! The breading was outstanding while the meat inside was marvelously melt-in-your-mouth good. It\'s unreal! Anyway you eat it, the taste remains superb.Their house tonkatsu sauce deserves a shout out. I love how it\'s so well-balanced with the tartness and sweetness that it doesn\'t mask the beautiful pork, if anything, it elevates it in new heights. The red miso soup is rather unique with a bolder and heartier taste profile compared to what we\'re accustomed to. I dig it, a lot! As for the cabbage, it just works in this meal, period. Knock yourself out with the orange colored dressing on the table. Heck, even the rice is a mastery. Okawari Kudasai, for sure! CHICKEN-KATSU (¥1,450) -- I try to avoid poultry if I can being both a carnivore and a seafood aficionado. After having a piece of the breaded white meat, I gave myself a second to stop and enjoy the moment of pure bliss. Did they just kill a chicken at the back and fry it? It\'s tender, juicy, and nothing like the chicken here in the States. If there\'s such thing as an A5 Miyazaki chicken, this would be it. Like anywhere in Japan, customer service is beyond amazing whether you are in a McDonald\'s or a fine dining establishment. And the craziest part? There\'s no tipping! I\'m blown away that up to this day, I\'m still reminiscing about the heavenly meal I had here.', ""Let me start off the review with the wait-time. The wait is worth it... I got there on a Thursday 4:30pm and I was the first in line. After 4:32 it was packed, check out the photos! It will be packed and be packed throughout the night. However it does move fast!! There's a lot of singles in lines and less parties. There's also one open table meaning you will be sharing a table upstairs, don't be shy, you will get the 100% phenomenal service.the Tonkatsu was tender, juicy and just the perfect chew. I ordered the premium cut and wow, I should've ordered two! it's so watery and so much flavor after just one bite. I didn't taste any extra batter, it was just the right amount! Once you're seated, I advise you to place your order asap (20mins to cook!). Again, once you're seated you should already know what you want.. otherwise you'll just become hangry waiting. The manager will pass the menu while you're waiting outside so be on a look out or just ask for the menu( I posted photos of the main menu ). Let me know if you have more questions. I would go back here!"", 'Went there last month during the Sakura festivities. \xa0We got in approx. 12:30 and was lucky enough to be the last ones in for lunch; 1:30 is the last order taken. \xa0The wait was worth it we had the 2 Tonkatsu combos and also the shrimp combo. \xa0This was the most tender and tastiest pork loin is ever had. \xa0It was not greasy and the have their own katsu sauce that I put on everything. \xa0The Tonkatsu takes about 20 minutes so we had we had some appetizers but it was good also. \xa0Since we were the last ones in the chef and waitresses were really nice and friendly.I will probably come back again', ""Juiciest tonkatsu I've had in Japan thus far. Off the bat, I would suggest getting here at 1130am due to the likelihood of there being a line with last call being 2pm.Food: Like I've suggested, this will most likely be the juiciest tonkatsu you'll ever had. I opted to get the set meal which consisted of a cabbage salad with a side mini salad dressed in a vinaigrette. You also get one bowl of rice and side of red miso soup. Price point is around 2000 - 2500 yen.Service: Like most Japanese restaurant this a essentially a quick service restaurant with the servers being the cooks as well. English menu is available but the amount of options won't get you held up looking at the menu.Ambiance: Small intimate restaurant about 20 seater restaurant. Find it difficult to just walk-in with a big group which will prompt you to make a reservation. Very relaxing place but it's not a lounging restaurant as you should finish your meal and just get out to be respectful to the people that are also waiting in line outside. Recommendation: Definitely worth checking out if you got the time and don't mind the wait. Its really good place to dine in on the occasion, however, you will definitely want to avoid this if you are coming here just to satisfy your stomach."", ""Marvelous pork katsu. Y'all, if you're in Tokyo and like pork katsu this place is where you have to go. Everything was great, EVERYTHING.""]"
18,Tamahide,4,26,"[""A restaurant that has true history in Japan! Known for their Oyakodon (chicken and egg rice bowl) that has been a staple dish since 1760..that's 260 years!! When you arrive, there's a line outside before it even opens although it goes by quite quickly. Once inside, you'll need to take off your shoes and the lady will give you a number to take since it's paired with your shoes. Afterwards, you'll head to a very small window and order and pay for your food. That lady will give you a small ticket to give to the server (the lady who guides you to your seat). If you're like me, I came alone so I said with random strangers. Be careful though because the tables are very low and your legs go inside of this lower hole in the ground. Once the food arrives, you're greeted with chicken broth and tea along with your meal. The birth was amazing and I wished there was refills like the beef broths from Korean restaurants. The meal itself was great and the chicken was extremely soft. The egg was fluffy and runny; made it even enjoyable. Honestly it was the best Oyakodon I've tasted whether in Japan or in LA and I'd definitely come back for more in the future."", 'Tamahide is one of very famous and classic \xa0restaurants in Tokyo. Around this area is downtown and there are traditional, cool buildings and atmosphere. There are a lot of traditional restaurants, this is one of them.You can enjoy and take a walk around here so I recommend you have it \xa0at lunch after sightseeing in this downtown.', ""In the months before I was to travel to Japan & Asia, I had been researching restaurants that I had to try. Tamahide was definitely one of my top picks. Although it isn't Michelin starred (it should be), this restaurant gets a special exception. Tamahide is the birthplace of the Oyako-Don, a classic Japanese dish. According to numerous sources, there's usually a really long line for the restaurant, so I MADE sure to wake up my travel mates to get there right as it opened. To my dismay, we got there a few minutes after the restaurant opened but there was already a line but thankfully it moved rather quickly. The restaurant itself is quite a throwback to classical Japanese dining. When walking in, they ask that you remove your shoes, customary for places that have tatami floor mats (I hope your feet don't smell). Your next step in Oyako-Don nirvana is to pick and pay for the version you would like. Fortunately for foreign tourists, they have english menus to guide you in picking.I went for the classic Oyako-Don and was ushered into the dining room. The dining room is constructed into the floor in a classical Japanese eating format, so you sit on a cushion on the floor with your legs under the table. After being served tea and warm towels, our orders finally arrived. Presented like a Russian nesting doll, the dishes open up to present you with one of most aromatic dishes of all time. Rich egg and tender chicken slowly simmered with a light soy over rice. The etherial combination of the light and fluffy egg over steamed rice from Tamahide, is easily one of the best meals I have had in Japan. I really wish I had more to say on the food but it really is a simple dish elevated to such complexities that it left me speechless. I've said this before and I'll say it again, but some of the best produce in the world is out of Japan, and Tamahide utilizes this to the extreme. This dish would not be able to exist in the United States solely out of lack of superior produce. With 250 years of existence under it's belt, I implore any travelers to make the effort to travel and dine at this amazing establishment."", ""One of the Oldest restaurants in Tokyo. Handed down to the 8th generation & been around for approx 300 years! They serve only one dish, oyakodon: which is chicken simmered in a sweet-salty soy based sukiyaki broth, sealed with omelette type custardy egg, and served in a bowl over rice. Comes with a cup of chicken broth which tastes so concentrated, roasted tea, and a side condiment that tastes like refreshing ginger which delivers the dish a great kick of flavor. Has to be one of my favorites next to Ichiran Ramen. Arrive early to get in sooner than later, as in an hour or more later!If you're traveling alone expect to be seated at a table of 4 with strangers. Remove your shoes up front, you're handed a numbered tag, they also have an umbrella lock station out front, pay first then sit on the floor with a sunken in section for your legs and wait for your dish to be brought out to you warm."", ""One of the things I love about travel is popping up out of a random subway station and poking around until i stumble across something interesting. I had no idea this place existed until reading one of the reviews that mentioned the Bon Appetite article. Again, if you see a line, there's a reason why people will take time out of their day to stand around and wait to give their hard earned money away.Such was the case with Tamahide. I could tell you about the food, which was not especially delicious. However the entire experience was something I was so happy that I was able to experience while in Tokyo. After waiting for about 45 minutes to get in, you're ushered into the interior where a woman takes your shoes and gives you a number. There you order and pay at a small window. After that, you queue again and then are seated within a matter of minutes. The dining room is very traditional and seats are sunken into small wells in the ground.Your food is brought out shortly and then you eat. As I said, the oyakodon is slightly sweet/ slightly tangy and the custard-like way they prepare the egg is very interesting. Overall, after a few bites, I'm afraid it just started to taste like I'd had enough. Not to say it was bad...perhaps it was too heavy? My son ate half of his and then sheepishly looked at me and said he didn't feel like eating any more.But sometimes the food doesn't need to be five-star to keep people coming back. The fact that this family used to serve this dish only to royalty is a pretty cool part of their history. And that they've been making this dish for around 300 years...wow. As we're getting close to the end of our incredible trip to Japan, and I reflect on our special time here, I remember this restaurant with fond memories."", ""One of the OG spots that you need to try. It's definitely a hidden gem in tucked in this little city of Japan (I forgot the train station stop) We got here at 10:45am and was 3rd in line. By 11:30, the line wrapped around the whole block! Traditional seating and communal dining. Know what you want because the ordering goes by fast! You can't be picky. If you haven't tried Oyakodon, you need to put this on your bucket list! Once I got my food, it was gone in less than 2 minutes. Yes, it's that good. For $15-$17 you'll definitely leave this place full and satisfied! Bon a petit"", 'We ordered a 2700 tamakodon called 元祖親子丼.

I loved all the meats that came out of the kitchen especially the prime rib, steaks and pork loin. Meats were tender and juicy melting in my mouth. The meats were perfectly seasoned. Not salty like other places I've tried. There is an all you can eat salad bar which had good soups, potato salad, meat balls and this fried potato that I could eat 20 of. Did I mention the grilled pineapple with cinnamon!?! It went very well with the meats and I loved it! I cant wait to come back here when I'm in the area."", ""Brasilica Grill opened late last year and is still not well known. However, this status will not last much longer.

I decided against some of the other fillers available such as curry and rice.Upon sitting down with my salad, the meat started to arrive. I loved this. At Barbacoa, the meat is brought to the table after finishing off the first plate of salad. I'd rather begin eating the churrasco meat sooner than later.The service was excellent. The churrasco meats were cut and served in generous portions. We didn't have to wait long for the next cut to come. My plate was never empty. The churrasco meats were all very delicious which also included sausage, chicken, and pork. I liked the garlic and sirloin steaks but the rump was probably the best cut served.

At first we were a little put off since it looked classier than we were prepared for (t-shirt, jeans, etc) but we had already committed. After we were seated Carlos explained everything and we took note it was exactly like the other Brazilian steakhouses we\'d been to. Score! Salad/sides bar had a good selection and they offer a drink bar option if you plan on having more than one. At first we thought they were a little uptight as they covered our backpack on the ground with a black napkin but we soon noticed they did that to all the guests, including the locals. Midway, the assistant manager Kazuki Karita came and chatted with us, asking where we\'re from and what we were celebrating. We casually told him we were on our honeymoon and even showed some pics. He quickly made our experience great and then he returned to ask our names. Little did we know, he and the rest of the staff came back with a ""Happy Wedding"" dessert along with a giant (almost as big as my wife) glass of champagne. The whole restaurant applauded and it was very sweet. Dessert was superb. They have a great variety of meats and they come around frequently so you never miss a thing. All in all, the staff really touched us and we would definitely go back. Very great service and the food was delicious.

I'd estimate maybe 20 or so people max. With that being said, I don't think it would be best for large parties to come here since you can expect to wait a very long time for a spot. The quality of the fish was as expected and we had a good experience. Despite us not speaking any Japanese, we had no issue in getting our payments settled and had an enjoyable experience.

This place always has a long line, but I was lucky to come early enough that I only had to wait about 5 minutes before snagging a spot at the bar. I ordered a sashimi bowl and my boyfriend got one of the tuna sets. The fish was fresh and the hospitality was great. We also ordered 2 pieces of uni and it was pretty good, but I've had better elsewhere."", 'While I am not someone who seeks out sushi, the people that I frequently find myself in the company of are, so I end up eating quite a bit of it. Despite arriving with a large group, this place was able to seat and serve us efficiently, which can be a challenge at non-conveyor-belt-style sushi restaurants. I was impressed by that, at least. Note that we did have a reservation, but the place was not as crowded as I read it might be. We sat in the below-ground level -- probably because we were a big group and the implication was that we\'d be there for a while ... and be noisy. The service was very good. We ordered a variety of things (of course the maguro (tuna) that they\'re famous for... and the uni -- the edible part of the sea urchin -- which is, apparently a delicacy. (I think I can leave that one off my next order, but it was interesting to try once.) The tiny shrimp that we used as an appetizer were cooked well: crispy and just the right size for picking up with chopsticks while we had a beer. We mostly had sashimi, with a few wrapped items (like the uni and green sand -- more on that later). The fish was simply plated and tasted fresh. We ordered some different ""fattiness"" levels of our tuna and it was fun to try the different types of the same fish. Each person received his own plate with each of 4 types (red, medium fatty, fatty, and broiled fatty), which made it convenient that we didn\'t have to pass plates around the large table. In addition to the uni, we also had something sandy and green that translated loosely as ""crab paste"" that we ultimately determined was the liver (tomalley), I believe. Another delicacy and something to try once, but I think there is a reason I don\'t normally eat it on its own... to be fair, it wasn\'t really ""sandy""... it just looked that way. Miso-marinated black cod is one of my favorite preparation and we ordered a bit of that to try. Sure, it is a cooked dish at a sushi place, but it is still amazing when done right. The way they prepared it here resulted in a buttery fish with some caramelization and a light miso flavor. It was very nice, but not the star of the show. Several people in our group like eel, so we each had some ""top quality sea eel"" as well. It is not really my favorite, and I was pretty full by the time that one rotated in, but it was likewise simply plated. The sake we had was very nice. I don\'t know much about sake, but it was a bit sweet but on the drier side, which paired well with the fatty tuna -- and helped clear things out after the uni and ""crab paste"". \xa0:|There are many Sushizanmai locations besides this one and some may be significantly closer to where you are staying, so check Yelp first. This one was slightly better than another member of the chain in Roppongi, but I don\'t know that it was worth the extra travel time since my coworkers were staying there and it was a 10 minute walk from their hotel to the other one vs. a cab ride.', 'Definitely not the best or cheapest sushi I had while in Tokyo, but mad props for being open 24 hours. So good I went twice in 24 hours, late night and for breakfast when my friends arrived. Quite a few locations within a couple blocks so if there is a line at one, you might try the others.

The seasonal special right now is with different types of mushrooms. Had this pizza on two different nights it was so fantastic!! Tonight also had the cinque formaggi that is accompanied by a truffle honey that is so wonderful and compliments the Gorgonzola cheese perfectly. We finished the meal with a chocolate pizza topped with frozen wild strawberries that were just bursting with flavor it made my mouth sing with happiness! Chef Ito was wonderful and explained ingredients and flavors all while doing magic with dough and cheeses and vegetables that were destined to make all the customers at the bar smile.']"
22,たどん,4.5,11,"[""I'm not sure Japan has bad donburi, because the last few I've had at various restaurants have been amazing.I was already in Akihabara, and this happened to be one of the highly rated places nearby. I stopped by and followed the usual steps: buy tickets from the machine, find a seat, and give the tickets to the server to redeem my food. It's pretty small inside, with maybe 15 seats or so along a counter. If you don't get a seat, there are chairs along the wall where you line up until a seat opens. I just clicked the first bowl and sat down. I can't read Japanese so I just went off the pictures. The server offered the lady behind me an English menu, which would have helped me but the server probably assumed that I was Japanese since I'm Asian haha...Once you hand your ticket, the server asks how much rice (called gohan) you would like in your bowl. This rice comes at no additional charge and you choose between small, medium, and large. Don't get too excited though just cause it's free. The amount of food you get other than the rice remains the same. I'd say the medium is a fair portion for most people. The server will give you a cup of water once you sit, but after that you'll serve your own water using their water pitchers on the counter. There are also kimchi jars between every few seats and you can take as much as you'd like. There's a smaller jar with spicy seasoning on the counter. The meat is super juicy and delicious. The kimchi isn't spicy but tastes surprisingly good regardless. Overall this place is awesome and pretty cheap. Would love to go back some day!"", ""Not bad at all but just ok to me when there are so many great options in Tokyo. \xa0I ordered one of the more expensive stone bowl dishes that came out boiling hot where you toss in an egg, so that was awesome. \xa0The broth was tasty and if you're into a fattier beef selection, this is your dish. Unlike my husband who rightfully got a rice bowl, mine was an udon bowl (so noodles 3 meals in a row was my mistake) - and yeah, this isn't really an udon place.However, the rice bowls I was told were tasty and kudos to the amazing kimchi on the side.

23,The French Toast Factory Yodobashi Akiba,4.5,34,"[""Yum Yum Yum!I came here with four friends to enjoy some sweet and delectable souffle pancakes (despite the name being The French Toast Factory haha). All I've got to say is that all the pancakes that we ordered were perfectly fluffy, sweet, and presentable. This cozy spot on the upper floor of the Yodobashi building in Akihabara does have many other options as well such as French toast and omurice. The service and seating is friendly and comfortable and I recommend this spot for a sweet dessert while in the area."", 'OMG! Their Citron Soufflé pancake is amazingly yummy! Very fluffy ! \xa0Very soft! Not super sweet. It comes with citron syrup on the side! I also got Chai French Toast. It was pretty yummy too! Love the smell of Chai and Cinnamon on it. French Toast is so custardy! Crispy around the edge! Will come back to try more!', 'As far as breakfast for dinner, I am a big fan. In this case, I was looking on Yelp to see what kind of restaurants were near us and, after many days of sushi, ramen, and even a restaurant that only served mackerel, how could I *not* want to go to a place called ""The French Toast Factory"" ?!? \xa0Bring on the bread! First off, the place was a bit of a challenge to find. Save yourself any trouble monkeying around with the GPS and various apps: the Yodobashi Camera building is HUGE and easy to find right next to the train station. It is basically a vertical mall for electronics and housewares (If you know of Mitsukoshi, it is like that, but for all manner of electronic gear). Get yourself into that building and up to the 8th floor. From there, this place is simple to locate. TIP: even if you have to wait a little, the elevator is a good way up unless you really like taking escalators. Plus, you don\'t get distracted by all of the ""stuff"" that you can buy here. I\'d suggest taking the escalators on the way down if you want to shop.The restaurant was pretty crowded, but we were seated and served quickly. The menu is pretty varied and they don\'t just have breakfast foods, or even just French toast: you can get ""real dinner"" food here as well: chicken and rice, loco moco, eggs, etc. The menu has SOME pictures and I think there is just enough in English that you can mostly figure out what you are ordering, although you may have some ""surprise"" ingredients: I am the husband who missed the ""ショコラアイス"" in the Japanese description of the ""Dark Cherry Compote French Toast"" that my wife ordered. Yup, it comes with a big scoop of chocolate ice cream on top along with the cherries... I thought it was a good surprise. Her, not so much. So, despite the name of this place, I ordered *pancakes*... HUH?!? I am a target audience for advertising: I saw the picture on a poster and they looked ""different"" from the pancakes we have in the US, so I had to give them a shot. (I didn\'t even know about the ""jiggly"" thing yet!) These things are thick but light -- more ""cake"" than ""pan,"" you might say. They\'re not really too sweet, which is a good thing since nearly all of them have some kind of topping on them, whether it is fruit compote, whipped cream, or various syrups or sauces. So, maybe instead of breakfast, I had *dessert* for dinner. Hmm...Since my wife ordered French toast, I was able to try that as well. It had a nice flavor and I enjoyed the mix of textures. A word of warning: the toast is cooked to a doneness that is consistent with the way that omelets are served in Japan: heated just enough so that the outside stays together, but the middle remains largely fluid. If that isn\'t your thing, beware. I don\'t know what would happen if you ask for ""well done,"" but that phrase seemed to be understood by many people in restaurants who cook eggs for foreigners, so it might work for you. While we were there, couples and small groups arrived and had coffee and dessert (if they\'re putting ice cream on French Toast, that\'s not quite breakfast anymore, right?) and hung around for a while, similar to what people do in a Starbucks, but with much better food and table service. They do take credit cards, which is nice.', ""My husband and I were visiting Akihabara when we noticed a food court on the 8th floor of the Yodobashi building. Breakfast for dinner sounded good, and the nice staff seated us right away.I ordered the Dark Cherry Compote French Toast and my husband got the Caramel Banana Pancakes. Now is the time that I should mention that he ALWAYS orders the best thing in new restaurants we visit. I should learn my lesson and just copy him! His pancakes were really delicious. My cherry french toast was just okay. That was partly my fault because I didn't like the eggy, gooey consistency of them. (But that's how most of the rest of the world seems to like things.)Luckily, I married a nice guy who is willing to eat some of my meal and share his. \xa0All in all, we liked the French Toast Factory."", 'A great place in a food hall. This place had western style breakfasts. Pancakes, eggs, and of course french toast. The pancakes were Japanese style which are smaller in diameter, fluffier, and airy. Yumminess! We had the banana pancakes, the french toast, and the spicy chicken with eggs. All in all a very enjoyable breakfast.', ""This review is based solely on the chiffon souffle pancake.It's the best souffle pancake I've ever had in both Japan and Korea combined. Don't wait \xa0 an hour for happy pancake in Harajuku; it just doesn't compare.The Hokkaido whipped cream is to die for, the crumb topping is decadent, and the pancake itself a pillowy cloud of perfect. I love that it isn't very sweet by itself and that you can adjust the sweetness with the syrup. I dream about this pancake at night.I also hear that the French toast is wonderful. But I'm in a happily committed relationship to the chiffon souffle pancake."", ""Why 5 stars? Because these pancakes tasted as amazing as they look. \xa0 --- \xa0 --- \xa0 ---One of the main reasons I was excited to visit Tokyo was to eat, and one of the top things I was excited to eat were jiggly pancakes. I don't think these were quite as bouncy as some of the other pancakes I saw online, but they were definitely delicious! The most painful part of our experience was having to choose which pancakes to go with. Just now, looking back at the menu, I'm kind of mad that we didn't order two different kinds. We had just come from eating lunch and were treating these pancakes as our dessert, but we definitely should have sucked it up and ordered a 2nd stack! We went with coconut, but I mean look at those other options: macadamia, caramel banana, strawberry, etc. If you look at their website, the photos will cause you to want to buy the next flight to Tokyo. But the best part is that the taste lives up to visual! The texture is not *that* much different than typical, flatter pancakes that you see in America, but the flavor is delightful. If you're looking for the restaurant and having trouble locating it -\xa0it's on the 8th floor of the Yodobashi Camera Building, which is definitely worth spending some time in!"", ""I've been wanting to try those famous fully japanese pancakes for so long and finally have found a place that serves it.

He's not too big on sweet either, but I'm glad he helped me, because the portion was much larger than we both anticipated. The sauce was creamy with the perfect amount of sweetness. The pancakes were so fluffy and delicious. It was fun jiggling it around before we started eating. I would definitely recommend coming if you're interested in trying the fuffly pancakes."", ""The French Toast Factory was my first jiggly pancake experience and I'm happy it was. It was the perfect build up to even greater pancakes in Japan (Cafe Gram). I ordered the whipped butter pancakes (750 yen) because I wanted to try them in its most original form. My excitement level was through the roof when it came because yes the pancakes jiggled! Honestly, that was what I was most worried about lol. However, they weren't as fluffy and as soft as they looked. Truth be told, it was a little underwhelming. I think I was just expecting something totally life changing because of its appearance. But I still finished the whole plate. The spicy chicken (650 yen) came with about 6 wings and they all had one bone only! The Bacon and Mushroom Potato Omelette (1200 yen) had mushrooms with gravy served on the side instead of being inside the omelette. It also came with toasted bread and salad. Everything was so Instagram-able here; the pancakes were thick and stacked nicely on top of each other, the omelette looked super fluffy, and they had cute graphics on the walls. They also had a clear window for customers to see the chefs making the pancakes. To wait in line, you simply sit down on the seats lined up against the fence of their restaurant. And they give you menus while you're waiting to speed up the ordering process. I think we went around lunchtime and there were at least 3 groups ahead of us in line. Getting here was so difficult though (thanks to Google Maps). The French Toast Factory is located on the 8th floor of Yodobashi. It's a whole food court up there. We were really tempted by the food displays at the other restaurants but trying jiggly pancakes in Japan is a must so we stuck with our initial choice. Anyway, we were already at Yodobashi when we Google Mapped the French Toast Factory but it took us elsewhere!""]"
24,Tsujihan,4.5,34,"[""This place is DELICIOUS! While in Tokyo, we attempted this place several times. But left because the the lines were outrageous. They only have about 12 seats inside. And we were pretty hangry, so had to seek for food fuel elsewhere. Then on our last day in Japan, which fell on a Sunday, my fiancé and I decided to drop by. We thought, it's Sunday, can't be that bad. Got here around 7:30pm, we were probably the 17th and 18th in line and the wait was still over an hour. But it was worth every minute of it! We both ordered the most expensive matsu bowl which included uni and we were both on cloud nine. It was sooooo good!

I waited in a two hour line to eat here. And the food was really good and very good value, but two hours of waiting was a bit much. You are given a menu in line and order in line so there is a lot of efficiency, but like a lot of places in Japan, there's not much seating inside. They also have a tea dispenser outside for you while you wait, which nice. I ordered the crab and ikura kaisendon. It was delicious and filled with crab and ikura."", 'We arrived about five minutes before they opened, on Tuesday, and they already had a line! About 20 people were in line. When they opened, they let 12 people in, as this place only has 12 counter seats. While waiting, a staff came out and started to take orders for the people in line. This will speed up the process, great efficiency! As soon as we sat at our seats, the chef offered us small plates of sashimi. They had four pieces of sashimi with miso sauce. It is recommended to leave two pieces of sashimi for later. \xa0They only offer four dishes, and they are all the same sashimi donburi. The difference is the amount of sashimi toppings that you are going to get. We went with Matsu, and added Extra Salmon Roe.Every bite was heavenly, especially for true seafood lovers! Depends on how hungry or full you are, you can either leave some rice in the bowl, or eat them clean. When you are finished with the bowl, put it on the counter, and a staff will pick it up. You can ask him to add some rice in the bowl, and then poured the Sea Bream Broth on top. Here, you put your two pieces into the piping hot broth. Very comforting, warms your body and soul from the inside. We left full and happy. I am so glad we got to try this place while we were in Japan!', ""DELICIOUS.If you're in Tokyo, I think visiting Tsujihan is definitely worth it. BUT get there EARLY. The line started about 30 minutes before opening and the place only sits about 10 people. Located right outside the Yaesu exit at Tokyo station, Tsujihan is convinient and amazing...The experience is really one of a kind. The atmosphere is quiet, food serving is very organized and traditional. You get to watch the chef prepare both your Zeitakudon and cut and prepare the sashimi that will ultimately end up in your bowl.The meal begins with three or four pieces of sashimi. Eat two and save the rest for later. Then comes your Zeitakudon with a permitted amount of sauce. Pour all the sauce over your bowl and go to town. From here, you should place your bowl (with whatever you did not finish eating or empty bowl) on the counter and the chef will fill it with tai-dashi. Before filling the hotel he will ask you if you want more rice, to which you can and should ask for more. Finish up the soup and rice and you'll finally reach foodie heaven.In terms of navigating the menu, there are three options (and a fourth that is very fancy). The only main difference is the quality of fish. Personally I've tasted all of them and the lowest quality is already so delicious it's hard to tell the difference. Whatever you choose, you can't go wrong.Happy eating."", 'One of the best meal in Tokyo. \xa0I know it is a tall order but true.', ""We made the mistake of coming here on Saturday. Got in line at 15 minutes till open at 11am. Had no idea how long the wait was. You get to a point of no return after one hour and we toughed it out for another hour before we gained entry into the inner sanctum. The joint looks like a high end sushi bar with only 12 seats. The chef is busy piling on heaps of crab on top of the rice and then pouring on ikura followed by a small mound of uni for the most expensive donburi at 3500 yen which you're damn right I ordered after that insane wait. The wife ordered the second most expensive dish at 1980 yen which didn't have the uni and half as much ikura. I gave her half of my uni to make it the same. So you already know it's good for all these local Japanese to que this long and it was really good. When you're done you put the bowl on the counter and the chef pours his special broth in it to make an ochasuke to finish off. And it was really really good. Now is it worth the wait???

Delicious!!!!And after you are done, place your bowl on top of the counter, and they will add more rice, and an absolutely yummy broth. That's where you will add your side dish of freshly cut sashimi with miso dressing. SO FREAKING GOOD! Expect a line, but it will be worth it!"", 'The wait was long but the food was to die for!! I think we went there 10 min after they opened (on a Wednesday) and waited an hour before being escorted in. Once you\'re inside they\'re quick to serve you your order because they take your order while you\'re waiting in line. The cheapest option is: ""Ume"" then it goes to ""Take"", ""Matsu"", etc. The only difference, I think, is the ingredients added such as ikura, crab meat, and uni. Once you\'re almost done with the bowl, you can ask for the soup to be added to your bowl by asking ""Dare onegaishimasu"" while placing your bowl onto the top counter. Basically a fantastic finishing touch to your meal! Soup was so delicious . Overall, would definitely go back again!!']"
25,Gyukatsu Motomura Akihabara,5,6,"[""I highly recommend coming to this restaurant if you want to have Gyukatsu (Katsu with steak inside). The restaurant isn't very big, so it's suggested to come in a group of 4 or less people. The server greeted us and luckily there were still some seats available (as time went on, the restaurant was packed fairly quickly. So it's recommended to come before 7pm). It was nice to have a worker that knew how to speak some English.There are boxes on the side of tables for you to put your bags and jacket in. Their menu doesn't have too many variety of dishes and mainly Gyukatsu, and side dishes available. They offer a set and just the Gyukatsu and the price differs by the gram (100g and 250g). Personally the 100g was enough for me, but if you have a big appetite, then go for the 250g. The orders came by fairly quickly (15 mins), and the server explained the cooking process to us as it was our first time. The stone boxes that are infront of each seat is used to cook the Katsu as they came rare, and you flip each side every 30 seconds-1 minute depending. Wow, each piece was so juicy and tender, and equally crispy. You can tell by the amount of sizzling on each piece as you cook it.Overall, definitely worth the price and visit. Was a pleasure and will come back again! :)"", ""Gyukatsu motomura is a definite must eat if you're visiting Akihabara. There's a number of restaurants scattered around japan, this specific one is located just North of Kanda River in Akihabara. The food here is AMAZING.

The food quality is A+ and to top it off, the price is reasonable for the amount of food that you get.Gyukatsu is deep fried wagyu cutlet that gives you total control on how you want your steak cooked. The cutlet comes out with a nice crispy crust on the outside, and rare on the inside. You cook it on your own hot stone over an open flame. Your cutlet is served with rice, salad, and miso soup to help balance out all the meat you're having.I have to mention that this restaurant is cash only!I will definitely come back for a meal here with no hesitations.

The beef katsu come to you still raw after they quick fry it so you can cook it to your liking, the little soup was also very tasty and the sauce that comes with it goes very well together. When Covid is done we're definitely coming back to this place"", 'Must go to if you ever visit Japan! Its beef steak that is coated in batter and deep fried so the beef is still rare. You get a stone plate on a fire in front of you for you to cook the sides of the steak to your liking. It comes with two dips, cabbage salad, potato salad, grated yam, miso soup, up to 3 sides, and rice with one free refill! You also get an option of one (130g) or two steaks (260g)! I ordered the Set C with one steak and one side that came up to 1400 JPY. You can also order it without the yam for 100 JPY cheaper. The price is great for the amount of food you get. Definitely recommend anyone coming to visit Japan to try this place at least once.']"

27,Devil Craft Kanda,4.5,31,"['Overall Rating: 4/5 stars.----------------------------DetailsValue: (3/5)Menu/selection: (4/5)Quality: (4/5)Service/staff: (5/5)Ambiance: (4/5)This review is based on a visit to the Kanda branch of Devil Craft Brewery. The best Chicago style deep-dish pizza in Tokyo can be had at any of the Devil Craft Breweries. I went the other night for some pizza, wings and beers at their Kanda location.We ordered \xa0a Deviluxe (double filling) Devil\'s Work pizza. It\'s a thick pizza piled with pepperoni, salami, Devilcraft\'s own house Italian sausage, mushroom, red onion, green pepper, spinach, fresh tomato, black olives, and stuffed green olives. Great food, beer and awesome atmosphere, no surprise that it\'s a long time favorite among Tokyoites.We also ordered some Buffalo wings and some onion rings. All the food here is tasty and scratches that itch for a taste of home. For more great places to enjoy international food and drinks in Japan, follow @gaijineatsjapan on INSTAGRAM and also join the Facebook group ""Gaijin Eats Japan"".', ""We went on a Sunday night and were able to get the last 2 remaining seats. This is a very small restaurant with maybe 20 seats. The beer here was great and the pizza was close to home (just less cheesy than you'd expect). The small is small - similar to a personal size pizza in the US. If you're looking for something a bit different while in Japan, give them a try - just be warned they may not have seats available."", 'Great place to go for pizza and beer. Everyone was nice and the food was awesome. Definitely a quaint neighborhood bar/pizza place. Highly recommend!!', 'Best craft beer bar I visited in Tokyo. Went with Luis and he agreed. We ordered 2 small size deep dish pizzas also and both of us agreed that the pizza was pretty solid too. Their best beer is the Arch Devil which is amazing! I think one of the best stouts I\'ve ever had. They told me they won some beer competition in the US(!) with this beer. Totally believable. This place is about 4 stories too but the best table in the whole place fits only 2. This honestly, is one of the coolest tables I have ever sat at. Why? It\'s located in the middle of the stairway on the way to the 2nd floor! It\'s totally quiet at this table compared to the rest of the place and somewhat intimate and you can watch the waiters bring up food and beer to the other floors. It\'s soooo cooooool! When you come here, and you\'re 1-2 people, absolutely ask for only this table! Luis and I loved it! They were shocked when we told them we absolutely wanted this table and not a normal table. While sitting there a waiter walked up with a carrying tray that had like 4-6 beers and I said to him, ""That\'s for me?!"" and he laughed but then paused for a second and looked back at me as if he had made a mistake and it was for me! Haha! We all laughed (including him) when he did that and he walked on up. Yeah, this place is pretty awesome.', ""My wife and I came to Tokyo, so:We don't like raw fish, so we went for deep dish.We found the spot easy and our pizza was cheesy. The beer was so good we did an IPA cheer. The price of the pizza was delightfully nice. There is seating on three stories, which added to our story. They might have made a deal with the devil, but their pizza is next level"", ""Devil Craft, you make me weep. I had come with such high hopes. I had read blogs and Yelp reviews and Reddit posts about how good your pizza was... Only to be so disappointed.Before starting, let me put this out there: I LOVE deep dish pizza. I will fight anyone who says NY pizza is better, because they're wrong. But I've come to realize that it's places like this that make people think NY style pizza is better. Let me start with the crust. The thing deep dish is KNOWN for! If you can't get that right, your whole pizza is going to be off. And they definitely didn't get it right. The crust was dry and bland and so tough. It was like someone got distracted and kneaded the dough for way too long.If that was their only sin, then I could still get behind Devil Craft. But it wasn't. The second most important part of a deep dish pizza, arguably the star (if not just the centerpiece) of the entire dish is the sauce. I mean, there's so much of it, it's impossible to get away with a bad one. Devil Craft's sauce tasted like the chef just opened a 88 yen grocery store can of cut tomatoes and dumped it in. It was just bland and had no flavor at all. I got a veggie pizza, and even the veggies weren't that good. How can you mess that up! They tasted like the chef forgot to put them on and hastily threw them on after the pizza had already finished cooking, because they were too hard and raw. There were a lot of vegetables, though, which was nice.Though their pizza was a huge disappointment, their waffle fries were so good! I also got a side of ranch (they charged me 100 yen for it) and the ranch was delicious. Tasted just like it does back in the States, not like any of this Japanese sweet ranch dressing nonsense. Their onion rings were only okay, but I'm more of a fan of breaded (not battered) rings.I won't be back. I'm still on the prowl for a good deep dish here, but I'm losing hope fast. If anyone has any recommendations, PLEASE message me. I'm getting pretty desperate."", 'Okay, let me just clear the air on one thing right up front: the pizza at DevilCraft is Chicago style, which means a big ol\' thick crust, not a flat crust. I neither know nor care how authentic it is, because it\'s delicious. If for some reason you only like thin crusted pizza, don\'t come here. Easy. Apparently some people only like one or the other style, but me, I\'m a pizza junkie and love both, so please don\'t even try to entertain that debate with me.Now that that\'s out of the way...A few years back somebody told me about ""the best pizza in Tokyo."" Seemed a tad hyperbolic, but a bunch of us decided to give it a go anyhow. Unfortunately, there was some kind of snafu with our reservation, and since Kanda is by far the smallest of DevilCraft\'s three venues, we couldn\'t get in. Nevertheless, I was still impressed because the owner himself came out, apologized profusely, and personally walked my group around the corner to another restaurant where he asked his friend the manager to take good care of us. So good on him, under the circumstances.Fast forward a few years, and I\'ve visited each of their locations multiple times. (Gotanda is the newest to open.) The food and beer are consistent across all three sites, so please feel free to extrapolate on that score. As I mentioned above, this venue, Kanda, is pretty small. The ground floor is bar-style seating, and there are two small stories above that. The staircase is narrow and twisting, so watch out if you have more than a couple pints and need to step out to the restroom. I\'m sure they don\'t want you tumbling down the stairs and getting blood all over everything.As I alluded above, the Chicago-style pizza at DevilCraft is amazing. The ingredients are fresh and plentiful, and the thick crust is tasty. A slice goes a long way, but you\'re still going to want more unless you\'re one of those weird pizza snobs I mentioned at the outset. On the visit for which I\'m writing this review (25 April 2017), my two friends and I had the Veggie Works and the BBQ Chicken pizza. If you\'re thinking those sound like weird choices, then we\'re on the same page. If it had just been me, I would not have gone with either of those. However, one of my friends doesn\'t eat pork, so this is where we wound up.That having been said, both pizzas were delicious. In particular, I was pleasantly surprised by the BBQ Chicken, which I had acquiesced to but was not that excited about. Turns out it was really good, so I guess I learned something that night. It happens.The craft beers are always great at DevilCraft. I started light with a golden lager, which was tasty and refreshing. Then I moved on to the porter, which is my favorite style, and liked it so much I had two of those. It had nice but not overpowering flavors of coffee and chocolate. I could drink it every day if my liver didn\'t give out first. Personally, I\'m not a big fan of the heavily hopped styles, but one of my friends said the double IPA was good. My other friend spoke highly of one of the imperial stouts.Be prepared for Tokyo-style pricing. A large pizza is going to set you back in the neighborhood of ￥2,500 - ￥3,000, and a large ""Meatzza"" is ￥4,000. But that comes with the territory here in the Land Of the Rising Sun, so it\'s not unexpected. Long story short, you sure won\'t find bargain basement prices at DevilCraft, but this is a great place for some food and beer with your friends. I recommend it highly.*Pro tip: These pizzas can take a long time to cook. Check out their menu online and call your order in ahead of time, and life will be a lot easier.', 'The line up of beers is excellent, but the prices are a bit steep. Having never lived in Chicago I cannot speak to the authenticity of their cuisine, but I must say from my experience stateside that I\'ve had much better ""Chicago"" pizza elsewhere. Traditionally Chicago pizza is served heavy, the deep crust crisp and buttery on the outside, with a filling that conceals the ""toppings"" between layers of marinara and stretchy cheese... I didn\'t find that here at Devil Craft, unfortunately. Their pizza is comprised of the ingredients most readily affordable/available in Japan, which sums up to a Japanese take on ""Chicago style"" pizza. It tastes good, particularly if you\'re hungry, but the prices and sizes are too much for too little. It\'s generally noted that 1 or 2 slices of real Chicago pizza will have you full and happy, and to that respect, Devil Craft\'s pizza is subpar. Go for the beer, stay for the beer, but also be aware there are better deals on craft beer in Tokyo. Due to it\'s popularity (or limited seating space) this restaurant is a real stickler for time, and staff can be perceived as a little pushy in getting you in and out...', 'Out of this world good tonight. \xa0No reservations but got an opportunity to sit at the bar. St florian IPA was amazing. Buffalo chicken and BBQ chicken pizza were delish. So happy right now! And thanks for your free wifi!', 'The Devilcraft chain is one of the best hidden gems of Tokyo. This deep dish pizza craft beer restaurant has great pizza and even better beer. When we come out to Devilcraft we generally get the Meatzza extra meat is always the best! The appetizers just hit the spot while waiting for your deep dish pizza.']"

This small 8 seat restaurant is the perfect example of simplicity and quality being best. They offer 2 types of pizza - with and without cheese. The crust is perfect. Just perfect. As there are only 8 seats I recommend going early and waiting in line outside just before they open.. you won't regret it. I'm still shocked that pizza was one of the highlights of my trip to Japan!"", ""My husband and I, just like many other reviewers, had seen Savoy featured on an episode of Ugly Delicious (Netflix series, check it out if you haven't already!). The pizza shop is located next to housing units in a neighborhood. There is limited seating inside, a few seats right at the counter where the pizza is prepared. The menu is small and very reasonably priced (pizza is ~$14 USD).We ordered three of the pizzas on the menu:- Margherita - This comes with Mozzarella & Basil.- Pizza O - This comes with Mozzarella & Ozaki Beef.- Pizza Y - This comes with Pacific Bluefin Tuna.All of the pizzas were amazing, Ugly Delicious was right to hype this place. This was the best pizza I have ever had in my life. The cheese is melted to perfection, the pizza breading was light and flaky and the ingredients were all fresh. My favorite pizza that I would say is a must try is the Pizza Y. Tuna on pizza might sound weird, but it was so delicious, some of the pieces of tuna are lightly cooked and other pieces are raw. I went here TWICE during my stay in Japan because it was THAT good!You can tell that the staff really take pride in serving the best pizza to their customers. I really liked watching my entire order being made, I ate an entire pizza by myself (don't judge me!)... I was full, but not disgustingly full where I felt sick. This will be one of my top recommendations to anyone traveling to Japan :)"", 'Savoy was recommended to me by a close friend and after seeing photos of this place from his past two Tokyo trips, I had to see what all the fuss was about. As you can see by my photos, this place is tiny, understated and conceptually perfect. I\'d recommend arriving 30 minutes early (I was) and was able to snag not only the first couple bar seats but the first two pizzas too! We opted to try both: the marg and marinara. The result...two of the finest pizzas I\'d ever eaten. Seriously, that good. Lives up to the hype and exceeds all expectations. The marinara was surprisingly the better of the two and I\'ll dream of it forever. Nike said it best, ""just do it"".', ""I first heard about this place from David Chang Ugly Delicious. This is the original location, they also have another one that is more fusion pizza. This place is super small, so make sure you come early or make reservations! It's super cozy inside and you get to the see the whole show how they make the pizza. They only offer two types of pizza, so you already know they are super skilled and good.We ordered the Marinara and Margherita pizza and both were delicious and super cheesy. The dough is more on the thin side, but super delicious and fluffy. I do not usually eat the crust, but I really enjoyed eating this one.Overall, experience and food was super memorable. Must try!"", ""Came here because of an episode I watched of Ugly Delicious where David Chang and Aziz Ansari ate at Savoy. Simply the best pizza I've had.. and the chef is a one man show. Very impressive! You can watch him kneading the dough from scratch, preparing homemade tomato sauce, and using fresh ingredients to top it off like grated garlic before he places it in an oven. I can see how passionate he is about his culinary. Really nice guy and just so grateful for everyone coming in to try his mouthwatering pizzas. Seating is really limited, only about 10 chairs. Waited about 15 minutes out in the rain, so worth it!I ordered the margherita pizza which was the first item on the menu and it was delicious! Great ingredients on a thin crust pizza. I ate it to myself and didn't feel gross so I ordered another. I got the Bianca which I found out through other yelpers is a secret menu item. Simply put, it was the bomb! If you're in Tokyo, Savoy is a must! Who would've thought the best pizza would be in Tokyo?"", ""Who knew that the best pizza I've ever had would be in Japan? I've been to Italy, NYC, etc, but this place really nailed it. After being featured on David Chang's Ugly Delicious, I knew I had to see what the hype is about.The space is quite small. Limited bar seats surrounding the chef and pizza oven. Expect to wait. We decided to show up around 5:30 and were the first to be seated when they opened at 6. The menu is also limited -- margherita, marinara and Bianca, the 'secret' menu item which is basically a white pizza consisting of cheese and alfredo sauce. I went for the margherita. Once you give the chef your order, he starts assembling your pizza together and pops it in the oven for 30-60 seconds. It comes out piping hot and steamy. The pizza tasted fresh, chewy and fluffy. So delicious! The pies are pretty small, so you wouldn't have trouble finishing it by yourself. It's also pretty light, so you feel satisfied, but not overly full. Seems like this place also has great lunch deals!""]"

The restaurant is somewhat small, with two private rooms, maybe 5 counter seats, and maybe another 8 tables inside. For the private rooms they ask you to take your shoes off and place them outside. They also ask you not to step on the floor too hard because the building is old? It was a strange request but I tried my best not to destroy the floor. Two people in my party had shoes that were difficult to take off so we opted to sit at the counter seats instead of private rooms as no regular tables were open.We arrived at 3 and were warned that they must close at 3:50. The menu had english on it. We ordered the chicken katsu, pork katsu, and pork/curry katsu. Haven't had too many katsu in my life so I'm not sure what to compare this place to, however their katsu is well executed. The breading is light and crispy, and the meat interior is juicy and tender. The rice was cooked perfectly as well. The price for the portion was slightly on the high side.The only issue was perhaps because they were in such a rush to close, they didnt fry the chicken all the way. If you look at the picture I posted when they first brought dishes out the chicken was a bit pink in the middle. 2 pieces were this way. We brought it to the waitress's attention, she looked at it, and thought for a few moments, then told us that was ok... We sort of looked at each other like... what? Then she came back a minute later to take the dish away. Then brought the dish back to us later a few minutes later. We think they fried it a bit more or replaced the 2 pieces that were pink. We're still not quite sure if anything was done. Only time will tell... I would recommend not coming so close to their closing time."", ""I have to jump ahead to the punch line: \xa0Hands down the best chicken katsu--in fact, the best fried chicken--I've ever eaten! \xa0It was just perfectly cooked, tender and juicy, so lightly breaded I couldn't believe it was fried at all. Not a trace of oil, yet a nice crunch with each bite. The waiter recommended trying it first with just a bit of salt and that combination was just divine. There is a much more potent vinegary and tomatoey katsu sauce and a dab of spicy mustard on the side of the plate you can add. To back it up a bit we came on a Saturday night having reserved a table ahead of time. We had to use google translate to explain to the wait staff who kept telling us to wait in line that we had a reservation already. \xa0Once they understood they took us to the cutest little private room alcove that could seat two to four. The place is simply decorated with black painted tables, tatami style seating (though the seats are actually benches so you can actually put your feet under the table and sit down like normal western place), with three clay pots on the side with a sesame salad dressing, high quality salt, and House katsu sauce. For two we ordered the chicken katsu set which came with shredded cabbage at the beginning which was perfectly light, a great way to pique ones appetite, and paired perfectly with the nutty fresh sesame dressing, then six pieces of divine fried chicken, with some lovely pickled greens and bamboo shoots on the side, and a bowl of rice. We also got the fried eggplant marinated in a nice soy sauce based glaze, and the half pork katsu curry udon which was lovely, quite fatty on the side of each piece and a tad chewy as a result but really high quality and again perfectly fried. The curry sauce was more nuanced and well balanced than any Japanese brown curry I've had before. The meal went nicely with sake. The staff was friendly and helpful, and all in all it was a perfect meal. We will definitely be back!"", ""The best chicken Katsu I have ever had - and I've had a lot of chicken katsu. The restaurant is located within walking distance to the metro line but then again, almost everything in Tokyo is walking distance to a metro stop. Upon arrival, there was a small line in front of the restaurant but that just means the food must be good. We waited about 10 minutes to be seated. Our server gave us English menus and we ordered a chicken Katsu and a pork Katsu.I don't exaggerate, and I truly mean it when I say the chicken katsu was the best I've ever had. Idk how or what they do to the chicken to make it as tender and crispy as it is. Honestly, after I finished my meal, I wanted to shake the hand of the chicken that I ate because he or she was delicious. If you're in Tokyo, make it a must see - Roppongi is a great area for foodies especially if it's late night. Five stars for this one."", ""Best katsu I ever had. It is sooo tender and all the sides match perfectly. It is also a very cosy place. I didn't find out if reservations were possible but just ended up waiting in line sometimes."", ""Came here because someone recommended it and confirmed by the rave reviews on Yelp. Perhaps we came on an off day (we've all had then haven't we?). The only enjoyable part of dining here was the wonderful service. The young lady waitress (who happens to be from Southern California) was helpful with menu selection and how to best enjoy their famous sasami-katsu (chicken tenderloin katsu). Speaking of katsu, we were very disappointed with the soggy-like panko coating compared to the much more golden brown, crunchy version we were expecting. Maybe it's the style here but their menu and wall pictures lead us to believe otherwise. The chicken was very tender as claimed, but the pork loin had too much tough chewy connective tissues to enjoy.Location is tucked away in a small alley right off the main street. Very convenient if staying around the Roppongi or Tokyo Midtown area."", ""Came here (based on yelp reviews) on a Sunday night around 6:30pm and there was already a line. We were actually lucky and only waited for about 20-30 minutes to get seated (four people). This was well worth the wait. Excellent service (spoke English well enough - very friendly / helpful), and even better food. We had the chicken katsu meal set and the assortment meal set - the cabbage & dressing and miso soup already had us thinking we made a solid choice to come here. Once we had the katsu tho, we were completely sold. This place is amazing. The katsu is the best we've had - lightly battered, not oily, super crunchy / moist. Nothing but great things to say and highly recommend.Price for 3 chicken katsu meal sets, 1 extra chicken katsu piece, and 1 assorted katsu meal set was about $55"", 'Another of our favorite meals in Tokyo. \xa0Perfectly prepared chicken katsu that is impossibly tender. \xa0 We would have come back to Imakatsu for a second meal but ran out of time during the vacation. \xa0Dip the katsu in some katsu sauce and their mustard, and even drizzle some of that katsu sauce over your rice. \xa0They\'ll happily refill for the bowl of shredded cabbage for free.While searching for this business, keep in mind that you will not see the name ""Imakatsu"" at the entrance, because the business name is displayed in the Japanese characters. \xa0We had to ask the hostess if we were at the right business because it\'s very easy to stand right in front of this business and not even realize it. \xa0If it\'s any help, the entrance is located right next to a ramen restaurant, and directly across the alley from a convenience store.', ""Tonkatsu is a breaded and deep-fried pork cutlet. According to sources, it originated in Japan in the 19th century. A pork filet or loin is floured, dipped into beaten egg and then coated with bread crumbs before being deep fried.

What arrived was a cold draft beer, a bowl of shredded cabbage and then my main course - a nice filet of katsu, sliced into several bite-sized pieces, a big bowl of rice, miso soup, and a small bowl of Japanese pickles. All of it was amazingly tasty and I enjoyed it thoroughly.A small complaint - the pork cutlet was not very well trimmed of fat. Each of the slices had a good quarter inch of it, which took away from a great meal.Looking for great Katsu? Here's the spot."", ""Hearing all the hype about the chicken katsu at Imakatsu, I knew I had to definitely try this place out given my workplace is just a 5 minute walk away. Came here for Friday night dinner and didn't have to wait very long for a seat. Ordered their chicken katsu and agreed it is definitely one of the top chicken katsu I've had ever. The chicken is extremely tender and juicy and the crisp batter provides a good contrast. However I did find it still a bit lacking compared to tonkatsu (pork). Meal comes with side of rice, miso soup, cabbage, and some pickled vegetables. Very satisfied with the meal, next time I come back I will definitely try the tonkatsu options!""]"
34,Ekibenya Matsuri,4.5,15,"[""Need a quick, affordable, and delicious bite on your shinkansen ride? You've got to go to Ekibenya to experience this - tons of options for whatever Japanese food you're craving, from sushi to fried rice, gyu-don, and more. They even have a 30-food item bento and other combinations if it's difficult to decide.The food itself may be a little bit smaller than American portions, but typically chock-full of rice, and between 800 to 2000 yen per meal. My recommendation is the gyu-don (beef over rice) - the marinade is sweet and savory, and it usually fills me up.Protip: they do take credit card, it gets crowded during peak meal times (like hard to move crowded...), and don't forget to grab a beer, since you can drink on the shinkansen (unlike many trains from where I am from).Note that most bento come with a hand wipe and chopsticks. Also, in case you do miss the one in the station, they do have limited bento options both on the platform and on the train (shinkansen)."", 'This place is a MUST for anyone who\'s traveling to other places in Japan by Shinkansen. The variety of ekiben in Matsuri is overwhelming to take in at first and deciding which ekiben to buy is even harder. I absolutely loved every moment when I was in this hectic and busy ekiben store. For those of you who don\'t know what an ekiben is, ""eki"" means train station in Japanese, while ""ben"" stands for bento box. It\'s a stable for everyone who\'s traveling on the shinkansen, so make sure you grab one (or 2 or 3 :)...) before you get onboard! Ekibenya Matsuri has a huge variety of ekiben, 170 of them! I roamed around the store trying to pick out the ones I wanted, but the selections were just so vast that I couldn\'t make up my mind and wanted all of them! They have a picture for what the bento boxes look like when you open them, so they help with the decision making. I know I wanted a raw fish/seafood ekiben, but I also wanted a fall seasonal one to really get into the mood of traveling in Japan during the fall season. I couldn\'t decide at the end and got 3 ekibens (don\'t mind me! haha). I got a chirashi bento, crab and scallop bento, and a fall limited edition bento at the end. The total came out to be ~3,000 yen, which is around $27 for 3. Great deal! My friends all decided on their ekibens after about 15-30 minutes of hard decision making. When we got onto the Shinkansen, we know it was time to crack open our ekibens. All of our ekibens were delicious and the fish and seafood were tasty. My friend got one of their self-heating bento and that was pretty cool! She pulled on the string and in matter of seconds, the box started to steam up and got really hot! My favorite ekiben which the presentation and taste really blew my mind was the fall edition bento. See for yourself in my pictures. The maple leaf touch and the colors in the bento were beautiful and I was amazed by how every single item from the larger items to the tiniest item were wonderfully cooked and seasoned. Best bento box I\'ve ever had in my life! What an experience to enjoy this beautiful and tasty bento box while traveling in a train that was going 180 mph from Tokyo to Kyoto!', ""Situated right across the Shinkansen (bullet train) area, this is an absolute must for any traveler. For the couple of days I spent in Kyoto, I would stop here every morning around 7:30 am to grab a couple of boxes for the day (it was too hard to pick just one, so I usually grabbed 2 or 3). They make for the perfect meal while traveling on the Shinkansen.I read some online articles about this place and decided to try the Tokyo Bento box, the Shinkansen bentos, and the Octopus Jar. All of them were great. The Tokyo Bento had the most food (I think the Shinkansen bentos might be for kids), which was very delicious, but be mindful as I found a couple of fish bones in my fish. I mostly got the \xa0Shinkansen Bentos because I wanted to keep the boxes, so I didn't mind the fact there was less food, as I picked up a curry sandwich bento as well.The Octopus Jar was perhaps the most interesting, I'm not a HUGE fan of octopus, but it was still good, and you get to keep the jar (which is very nice)."", ""This place is a must-go if you're about to hop onto a shinkansen (bullet train) and need something to feast on during the ride. Keep in mind that this place is outside of the shinkansen ticketing gate, so give yourself plenty of time to browse before going through the gates--it's not always possible to leave once you go inside the ticketing gate. There are a few smaller (significantly smaller) bento shops inside, but don't get your hopes up. The selections are minimal and nowhere as fancy as the ones you will find at Ekibenya.Don't forget to ask for a warmed bottle of miso soup to go with your bento box at check out (they are only kept behind the cash registers, so many tourists aren't aware that they even exist). They are indeed extra (¥), but a nice compliment. I purchased the salmon/fish egg bento box, and my husband got the uni/fish egg bento box. The salmon one was definitely worth the price tag, but the uni... not so much. Uni was dry and maybe even pickled to some extent to preserve the 'freshness' and taste. Do yourself a favor and don't get the uni."", ""You must purchase the bento here and I mean it's a MUST. Quality and presentation is great. Some bentos are quite pricy. One hint it's to purchase the top 1-2 seller which has signs indicating it. I have brought 4 bentos from cheap to expensive. All of them are great."", 'Grab yourself a delicious bento box and enjoy it on the Shinkansen.

The location is hard to find - it's in the JR station but before you go brought the gates for the Shinkansen. Thankfully the guy at the gates let me leave again to go back to get my bento!The selection is huge. I didn't see much English signage so it's a matter of looking at the pictures and guessing. I got three bento: octopus jar, hot beef and another one with a selection. All up it cost about ¥3000 (£18) so good value for lunch. You can also buy beer, wine, soft drinks. This place gets crazy busy so allow time for browsing and waiting in line to pay. But it's worth it!The octopus jar was delicious. A lovely ceramic pot with rice, veggies and pieces of octopus on top. The chopsticks it came with were cute too as they were retractable ones I hadn't seen before. Graeme's hot bento was great - you pull out the yellow string and wait 5 minutes and it heats up your food. I don't know how. Wait until everyone is seated to do it though as we had to pick it up to move it to let someone into their seat and it was super hot!Everyone on the Shinkansen has bento boxes so make sure you get one otherwise you'll feel left out. They didn't seem to be selling bento on the train so I was super glad we came here.Note; the sign for the shop isn't in English so thanks to Yelp for the photos otherwise I'd never have found it!"", 'This specialty store focuses on the Japanese culture item called ""Ekiben"" which means train (Eki) boxed lunch (bento).They have all sorts of high end 1,000 - 2,000 yen bentos and some of them heat themselves. \xa0I got the beef tongue steak bento with the self heater. \xa0All you do with the self heater is pull the string out and wait six minutes. \xa0A heating tab reheats and bam, you have a hot lunch on the bullet train.They have tons of options from beef to seafood to vegetarian. \xa0If you don\'t feel like rice they have sandwiches and other options. \xa0This shop also has drinks, water to small portable wine. \xa0So before you go on your bullet train trip hit up an Ekiben!', 'Convenient spot to pick up some bento boxes before a long Shinkansen ride.

However, the menu here is more upscale than other locations as there is a choice of premium cuts of pork. However if you want a lower quality of pork they have that too.

I do think it\'s considered to be slightly on the pricier end for Japanese prices for tonkatsu but still very reasonable. I love the way they serve it to you and the crisp factor on the meat is so great!! It is crispy but will melt in your mouth. You can get the set or just the tonkatsu. You can get fillet cut or loin cut - I personally like the loin since it has the fatty portion but the fillet is also good and I think it\'s supposed to be a high quality cut as well, with less fat. (for a ""cleaner"" taste)Try the sauces on the side of the table, they are great with the tonkatsu!! And they do not taste like the standard bottled tonkatsu sauces.Note: There are multiple locations, the Aoyama being the main store and Shibuya Hikarie being another one (and maybe a few others). I\'ve also been to the Shibuya Hikarie which is slightly nicer inside and fancier than this location, but the taste was the same to me so I\'d say go where it is convenient and where it won\'t be super crowded.

I got the cheaper tonkatsu loin cut and loved the beautiful, flaky panko breading. But above all the reason I'm giving this restaurant five stars is for the incredible service they provided to my mother who is vegetarian. Mom checked out all the restaurants on the 12th floor there and none offered a solid meal for a vegetarian, so she met me back here where they proceeded to create a lovely platter of foods for her, including frying up some mushrooms as seen in the photo and ensuring she could eat the ingredients of everything on the platter.

Looking at both tonkatsu, you couldn't tell the difference. I took a bite into our tonkatsu and it was delicious. The panko was light, the dish wasn't oily. But the meat did not melt in my mouth.

After spending a few weeks eating all the typical Japanese traditional dishes I really wanted to try something different and Sapporo Dominica really hit the spot.I opted for the original Dominica soup along with the Hamburger Steak which is apparently limited with a level 3 spicy level, and 180g of rice. \xa0The dish looks amazing and tastes amazing and is not like the usual thick Japanese curry and more like a very very light curry soup packed amazing flavors that will really blow your mind. \xa0The pilaf rice was a very good compliment to the soup and really balanced out the rich flavors of the soup. \xa0My wife ended up with the same Dominica soup with the Special chicken vegetable soup with an array of seasonal rustic vegetables that really tasted like they were pulled right out of the garden and tasted amazing.Overall Sapporo Dominica is a really good restaurant to try when you are in Ginza. \xa0The restaurant is really small with only maybe seating for 10 people so make sure to either come early or you might have a have to wait. \xa0I will definitely be back when I am in Ginza.', ""Every good vacation should end with a kickass meal and we concluded ours with the best food at Sapporo Dominica Ginza! The restaurant is a bit of a walk from the main drag of Ginza and the wait can be on the longer side with how limited seating is but, trust me, it's worth the effort if you want the good stuff... and if you are outta cash like we were because they take credit card! I've never known Japanese curry to be anything other than thick and creamy, and this place blew my mind. The curry here is more like a soup, served with a side of rice, and packed with all sorts of ingredients. Even better: it's all customizable! Four curry bases, seven sets ingredient sets, ten spice levels, four rice portions, and a handful of toppings for you to get whatever your lil heart desires. I ordered the Special Chicken with Tonkotsu Soup Curry and it was excellent. The curry was incredibly flavorful, there were so many veggies, and the meat was fall-off-the-bone tender. For spice-level reference, I got a level 1 because I didn't wanna get too crazy before a flight. I consider my spice tolerance level to be fairly decent and, tbh, I'm scared to know what level 10 would be like... Man, so much to eat and so little time to eat it all when in Japan. If Dominica's curry soup was this bomb dot com on a hot summer day, I can only imagine how out of this world amaaazing it is during the fall and winter months. Fingers crossed I'll be back again someday or that I find curry magic like this in America!"", ""This place was walking distance to our hotel. We ate our first meal, and it was so delicious. They even had a good vegetarian option. The place is small, but we didn't have to wait long. The service is very friendly. Didn't have to wait long to get our meal. Lastly, prices were also very reasonable. A must tr"", ""Today I travelled pretty far and didn't eat much all day. This tonkatsu broth, with pork soup curry and a soft boiled egg and crispy grilled cheese was so amazing. Delicious is an understatement. The waiter is the same guy that made my meal and he made it amazingly. My soup had potato, carrots, onion, a little baby corn. This was comforting and delicious on a rainy night. Like something my mom would cook. Really hot the spot. Amazing ambience and attentive cook/waiter/owner? All 5 stars."", ""There is nothing quite like it, and I mean it in the best of ways. Comforting, delicious, and full of flavor. They workers are friendly to tourist, and offer an English menu for those who cannot read or speak Japanese. I highly recommend the original soup base. For spice level, I recommend 4 if you can handle a moderate spicy level, 5-6 (if you are used to more Thai-level spice). Space is tight, so I don't recommend it for big groups."", ""I read lots of good review, so I tried. Wow! It is great. The curry is just right. It is not like normal creamy curry, it is like a soup. It is very yummy. Highly recommend this store. The store is very tiny, it may fits total 30 people. I went there happy hours 3-6pm so not bad, I don't need to wait. Also I got a drink for free."", ""One of the more memorable meals I had in Tokyo. And only because it was unlike anything I've ever had. Although it tastes like Japanese curry, the curry is more like a soup/broth. Therefore, it's not thick or heavy in any way. Ordering is easy, you pick the soup base, the type of ingredients you want (chicken with vegetables, vegetables only, pork etc), spice level (1-10), rice, and any add ons). We both went with the original curry and had both the special chicken curry and the vegetable curry. The vegetable curry has 12 different types of vegetables and half a soft boiled egg. I really liked the vegetables that that they used and I recognize a lot of local Ingredients. The small rice is equivalent to half a bowl of rice, they put it on a plate and it's flattened. I think the medium rice is the perfect amount. The space is rather small (like most places in Tokyo), bar with about 6 seats and 3 tables that can fit up to 4. Highly recommended if your in the Ginza area."", 'I loved this place! Staff was very nice and the soup was fabulous! I had the signature broth with the chicken/vegetable/egg option. I also added the grilled crispy cheese which seemed so bizarre but it was great and I would highly recommend. Yum', 'This is a second-floor Japanese curry spot. We ordered the original chicken curry with the grilled cheese and medium rice. Our food was made quickly and was so delicious! Great level of flavor and perfect mix of vegetables. Highly recommend!']"
39,BLACOWS,4,61,"[""Located in Ebisu is a well-known premium burger restaurant in Tokyo, known as Blacows.With burgers made 100% from Japanese wagyu (Japanese black Angus cows - hence the name of the restaurant) and buns from Maison Kayser, you may be paying a bit more for Blacows but you will eventually know why the restaurant is considered as one of the best gourmet burger restaurants in Tokyo.But let's go a little further with why this place is so special when it comes to meat.As many of you know the most popular meat (and expensive meat in Japan) are Kobe Beef, Matsuzaka-gyu, Yazawa-gyu and A5 rank wagyu. \xa0Blacows wagyu is made from Yazawa meat ala kuroge wagyu and as for Maison Kayser, this is why the buns are also special and becomes a major component to the burger.The restaurant is quite cool look inside, well-decorated and clean. \xa0Customer service was also excellent!But I had to check out the burgers and deciding which one should I pick. \xa0It's important to reiterate that this is a gourmet premium burger restaurant, so don't expect under Y1000 burgers.I decided to go for the Bacon Cheese Avocado Burger, the most expensive burger on the menu at Y2100. \xa0And for Yazawa-gyu, I'm willing to pay that much as it's truly a great deal. \xa0The extra veggies may be a bit much, as extra toppings can cost up to Y200.And with the burger, you would get the burger, Italian pickle, salad and fries.As I bit into the burger, you literally taste the delicious bread/meat and it was so delicious that I couldn't think of anything else. \xa0It's extremely juicy and delicious.I have to say it's one of my top 3 burger places to visit in Tokyo, but it's also one of the most priciest. \xa0For some people, the price and the price to add toppings to your burger, it may turn some people off, but again, for quality meat and awesome burger, this place is definitely worth it!If your looking for a premium gourmet burger in Tokyo, you'll definitely want to try Blacows in Ebisu!"", ""Great Kobe cheese burger in Tokyo. You will hear the chef slapping the Kobe beef patty individually before they cook it so you know it's not premade and it's created fresh. Amazing texture, consistency and beef.They also serve some craft beer from Coedo (Saitama prefecture), and they also show which \xa0their vegetables came from at the entrance. See my photo with the chalkboard. We'll be back, Blacows!"", 'We ordered two Blacow Wagyu cheese burger and it definitely lived up to the hype! Super delicious, beefy, soft and oily beef burger that\'s totally worth the price! We really enjoyed their homemade tangy sauce on the burger (not so much their barbecue sauce though) and the side of pickled vegetable was such a nice touch that helps cut through the fattiness of the burger. Their Hokkaido fries was very ""meh"" just taste like potato wedges seasoned with salt. Nothing to call home about.Nonetheless, their burger was delicious and definitely worth the price! Would recommend them!', 'Very good place, if you want to relax with the music while trying the best Wagyu Japanese Burger and the incomparable service...100% recommended.We had the cobb salad and avocado cheese burger...white wine and vodka with orange juice of course..LOL', 'Came here for lunch and enjoyed an awesome burger to fulfill my American craving for back home familiarity. The restaurant space is great whether you\'re dining alone or with a group. I decided on a less traditional burger - the bacon and egg burger. Because being in Japan, I thought ordering the burger alone wouldn\'t be enough so I added the ""set"" option that is a side salad and drink, AND a side of lettuce & grilled onions (well, because the waiter said it didn\'t come with the burger I chose). Honestly, the burgers and fries were more than enough, and I was hungry too!Of course you must know by now that the burgers here are made with 100% Kuroge Wagyu beef that is hand carved and hand ground in-house. I would rate the size of the \xa0burger a large. The waiter instructed me to enjoy the burger with a fork & knife, or use a wax paper wrapper provided table side. The burger came with a small side of steak fries but hey, who comes to a serious burger joint for fries anyways. Nice up tempo music playing makes me wanna dance the happy dance with the burger in my hands. Give this place a visit.', ""Good burger spot in Japan! I was in Japan a month ago- sorry for the late review!

Located in the upscale neighborhood of Ebisu where if they had a TV show called ""House Wives of Japan"", this is where they would be located. The ambience of the restaurant is a casual burger joint with a clean look. There\'s a bunch of mounted cow skulls on the wall just in case you forgot this is a burger joint. They offer a lot of options of burger but we ordered:Bacon, Cheese, Avocado Burger: this was my wife\'s choice. She loved the burger and even thought about ordering another after.Big Blacow: this burger had everything. Egg, Bacon, Cheese, Lettuce, Onion, Tomato, and their house sauce. Every ingredient was top notch. The Black Waygu Beef was delicious. This burger is so massive that it has to be eaten like two open faced burgers. I\'ve never had a burger more satisfying and full of flavor.The service was pleasant and average for Tokyo. Not the best service but good enough. I have to say it\'s the best burger I\'ve ever had. If there\'s any better God must have saved it for Himself.', 'Hands down phenomenal burger. Worth the price. Fries are delish. Zucchini fries not so much for the lack of seasoning or salt.Hit this place up for a sexy ass piece of meat.', ""So close, and yet so far...The burger is very well constructed, the toppings are delicious, bun is great, proper number of fries (few) and those are great as well. Ironically, the problem here is the patty. It's waaay overcooked. If you're dealing with quality ground beef - and here's it's a Wagyu(!) patty on a $20(!!) burger - you leave it pink in the middle, medium-rare; bleeding, juicy, flavorful. This one was gray all the way through...yikes. Everything else is so well executed that it pains me to give it three stars, but I don't have much of a choice. This wasn't a bad meal at all, but for the price and given the beef, I definitely expected more."", ""Back in 2009 when Blacows first started they offered great lunch deals beginning at 1,000yen that included a salad. \xa0Fast forward 5 years and no longer do they have a great lunch value menu and gone are the days of the 1,000yen price point. \xa0It seems the menu pricing is the same for lunch and dinner with the exception of getting a drink and salad for an additional 400yen.A plain burger with fries and a baby pickle rang in at 1,296yen. \xa0I mean Tokyo had some fabulous 1,000yen lunch spots like Hungry Heaven and The Great Burger that offer so much more for so much less. \xa0Ebisu just has so many other value lunch choices and this may have been the reason Blacows seemed a bit more empty then days gone by.The plain burger with the special sauce was very tasty and the bread so perfectly crispy on the outside and chewy in the middle but was it worth the 1,296yen? \xa0Nah...

The service was perfect, so if you're traveling abroad and need a quick taste of home, this is a great spot. Everything we saw go by was better than the last.

The price is reasonable comparing to the ones in the US, but kind of pricy considering other options around this place. It didn't taste fantastic, just average. I could have cooked a better one if you decided to wake up half an hour earlier. It wasn't a kind of dish I'd look for at a restaurant--something special, something I can't cook at home.One server was really nice (looked like a manager), but the others were unattentive. Not a bad place in a great location. But I'd pay for other things that are more interesting and delicious.

It's a small underground restaurant, they seat about 8-10 people and the turnover is very fast! You will not wait too long unless the line is long of course. You can order different sets, single serving or double portion for the beef katsu which comes with rice, salad, miso soup and grated mountain yam or radish. The beef katsu is bleu, only the surface is quickly fried with the katsu breading and you can sear it to your preference on the ishiyaki hot stone in front of you. Such a great experience.

I'd recommend getting here a bit before opening if you can, to avoid the dinner rush. When you're in line, you're given a menu and a worker asks you to order. By the time we sat down, our food was basically ready and served within 5 minutes! I got the 150g set and the grated yam, and when we were there, there was a special for a 200g set that my boyfriend got. I wasn't a big fan of the yam - it was kind of slimy, and stringy, but everything else was wonderful. You get a small stone stove that you cook your meat on.

Definitely would recommend!"", 'Last year, during my trip to Japan, I visited this restaurant for dinner. This was one of my favorite meals throughout the whole trip!

I strongly recommend checking out this restaurant.', ""Gyukatsu Motomura is worth all the hype!! Gyukatsu was one of things at the top of my list to try during my 2019 trip to Japan and it was one of my favorite meals.

(Japan tip: if you're trying to eat at a popular restaurant, plan to go there during lunch time on weekdays if possible!) The restaurant is very small and it is bar seating only. Each person gets their own personal little stone plate to grill their rare gyukatsu. The meat quality here is great; it is so tender even if you accidentally left it on the grill a little too long. Tip: grill not only the meat sides but also the breaded sides so that it's hot and crispy! Overall it is a great spot for a hearty lunch, especially if you're doing lots of walking on your trip.

Seating area is tiny - mostly bar seats with about 2 tables on the side. Prices are great for how much food you get, in japan standards.Meat is perfect in every way, sauces complement it well.

I docked this place due to the 1 hr wait, but other than that this was one of my fave stops/meals during my trip. Since it's a popular spot I recommend coming here early since there are only about 10 seats at this location. We came around 6:30PM on a weekday and for 2 people we waited about 1 hr. Since the location in underground with stairs leading up to the place, there is no waiting area so you'll need to stand in line the whole time. I liked that while you were waiting in line the waiter took your order ahead of time, so by the time you were seated your meal was already there within 2 minutes. I got the 180g and that was more than enough. The beef cutlet had a nice thin and crispy coating and the inside is a little raw so the experience of this place is that you get to cook it yourself on the plate and season it in different ways. They have a small instruction card if you've never done it with suggestions on how to eat it - you can eat it just with rock salt or in one of their two sauces they include on your plate. My fave way was just with the rock salt. I passed on the radish which is 100 yen less and I'm glad I did since it wasn't my thing. The sauce for the cabbage was delicious and I left with my plate clean.They are cash only and the dish ranges between 1,500 yen + depending on the size and set you order so be prepared. Can't wait to stop by again on my next trip!"", ""Tender, fatty, crispy, savoury, melt-in-your mouth beef cutlet. If you come here after 5pm, expect to wait at least an hour for dinner. The shop is tiny, but they take your order while you're in line so you can eat almost as soon as you're seated. It was definitely worth the wait and after a long day of walking around the city, you'll want a big filling meal like the one you'd get here. I opted for the smaller size (150g) cutlet and it was more than enough. I also got the grated yam, which was a goo with a light yam flavour. The yam and the mentaiko were my least favourite from the set but everything paired well for me. Highly recommend this spot for an affordable yet quality meal in Tokyo.""]"

47,Udon Maruka,4.5,43,"[""3.7 stars. Got there around 5:35 right after they opened and there was only one person ahead of me. They were out of kitsune udon already somehow?? so I decided to get cold udon without toppings. The broth had a pronounced fishy smell and tasty-not in a bad way despite how that sounds. Surprising amount of green onion. Couldn't have asked for better noodles-great firm chewiness and good width, not too hard or soft. Very long. I don't think this was that much better than marukame or most chains. If this is the best udon in Tokyo (according to Tabelog), it's great for the price, but maybe udon is just not the kind of food that can blow me away. Definitely tasty if you don't have to wait. The line was crazy by 6:50 or so when I left."", ""When I told my friend that the best ramen I've had in Tokyo is Hanamaru, she immediately told me to try out this udon place. There was a small line out the door when I arrived, but the line moves very quickly. The server will ask you what you want to order while you're in line and there's no English menu. I ordered the niku udon(肉うどん)The udon is firm and the texture is amazing. The udon came topped with bonito flakes, spring onions, and an excellent portion of pork. The broth was light and complimented the noodles perfectly. I also ordered a side of karaage which I dunked into the broth. It's a mixed bag of whether you're going to get white meat or dark meat karaage as I got one of each. Other tempura options are also available as I saw the person next to me get octopus tempura.I wish it didn't take me so long to find this place because I used to go to school right around the corner."", 'Udon Maruka was by far my favorite restaurant of the ones I visited during my short time in Japan (sorry, Afuri!). Not only was the food delicious, but it was fast + cheap. And there aren\'t many places I would recommend that fall under the ""fast + cheap"" category apart from In N\' Out. But this is Japan and people here master just about anything they work on, so food from Japan deserves a category of its own.//pro-tip// Knowing the popularity of this place, my friends and I visited during non-peak hours, which I highly recommend because there was a line forming out the door when we arrived past the lunch hour. Supposedly, people wait about 45min rain or shine. To me, our wait felt shorter (maybe 30min?) because we spent some time in line deciding what to order. //food// Like many people have said in past reviews, there is no English menu. So we used a combination of the Google translate app and the recommendations of a nice Japanese lady who briefly explained the menu to us. The language barrier sadly kept me from fully comprehending what I ordered. I just ordered the meat option, which had thin slices of beef over Sanuki udon in a dashi broth with iriko (dried, fermented fish) sprinkled over it. The Sanuki udon is a chunky white wheat noodle with a chewy consistency. *ALWAYS* order the udon with a side of tempura. I ordered mine with ebi (prawn) tempura. I loved it! Judging by their quiet focus on the food, I can tell my friends enjoyed it as well.//two thumbs up// As for the overall dining experience, I would say seating was interesting. There were 5 of us and we were split between 2 tables (3 + 2). 3 of us were seated at a table accommodating 4 people and our 2 friends were seated at the table next to us accommodating 2 people. Unfortunately, no pictures were allowed in the restaurant. But aside from the fast service, this contributed to the quick seat turnover. We were in and out in ~30min, partly because we placed our order while we were waiting in line. Efficiency at its finest. At $10, this meal was worth the wait. When I come back, I\'ll be sure to drag some friends to visit it again with me!', 'Cute little local place! There is no English menu and very little time to look at a menu, so I just ordered the first udon my phone translated and it tasted great! Cozy atmosphere, good food, great prices.', ""Smallish & simple udon restaurant... but that doesn't stop a continuous line from forming, despite being a quick in & out place. They really only serve 4 styles - in broth or dip broth, either hot or cold. No english on menu, but its just one of those with a side tempura dish. Our chicken is full of white meat deliciousness. The base noodles are under 500yen, so your entire meal is usually not much more. So cheap-ah!! Toppings include scallion, sesame seeds, hot spice & all the tempura flakes you can want. Seating is small but fast turnover."", 'Highest rated udon in Tokyo and and fifth nationally (three of which are in Kagawa). Still not an udon expert, but thought it was very good though a bit saltier than it needed to be. Triple tempura because I did not have lunch. All were good, but the chicken in particular was delicious because it was marinated in black pepper before frying, which made it taste like karaage (a good thing).', 'Arrived at 11:30 AM on a Tuesday in the summer, waited in line behind about 30 minutes behind about 30 people, and had some fantastic noodles. \xa0The line moves fast because the diners mean business. \xa0Everybody is slurping away, not distracted by conversations. \xa0Great place to get your own slurp on. \xa0I had the kamatama (hot udon with egg, scallions, scallions, and wasabi), which was delicious. \xa0Worth the wait.', ""Well worth the quick wait in the fast moving line (where towards the end they bring you a menu (all in Japanese though there is a partial English-Japanese menu next to the door, and take your order). I shared the kamatama hot udon with an egg quickly scrambled in, green onion, and yam, with soy sauce on the side to be added to taste; the bukkake cold udon with shaved bonito flakes, green onion, grated daikon, and little micro green sprouts; and a shrimp tempura on the side. The total for all this was $15 USD (1500 Yen). The tempura was quite large and not oily though the batter was a tad thick. The two udons were fantastic: \xa0al dente, as is the kagawa style, subtly balanced flavor wise and nicely paired with fresh, simple ingredients, and slurp-worthy. I had wanted to try the kitsune large tofu udon but it wasn't available today. At the table you can add vinegar, freshly ground toasted sesame seeds, tempura flakes, and chili powder seasoning. \xa0There's also water jugs you can use to refill your water glass, and Kleenex on a little bench underneath the table. This place is popular for good reason."", ""Loved this place! Not only was the food delicious but it was also such a great experience. My boyfriend and I got the Niku udon - it had sliced fatty beef, bonito flakes, green onion, fresh udon noodles and a flavorful broth. You have the option of adding tempura bits, sesame seeds, furikake spicy seasoning and vinegar. I recommend adding them, they're very good. We got a side of shrimp tempura too.

(Unfortunately, they didn't have Uni that day, which they had informed us when we'd made our reservation.)The sushi was fresh and delicious. Very high quality. The Grand Fatty Tuna was so good we both ordered it as our additional piece of sushi of choice. The Anago was also very soft and one of the best I've ever had.Our meal also came with an appetizer (which is 330 yen automatically added to your bill), Japanese egg omelette and miso soup--all of which were very tasty.We'd been considering ordering some additional sushi a la carte if we were still hungry, but the Kachidoki set was quite filling.Since we'd booked last minute, they only had seating in B1 available, but atmosphere-wise, the first floor counter seemed to be nicer.Sushidai Annex, which is within walking distance from this one, also offers the same menu.I can't wait to be back again the next time I'm in Tokyo."", ""I was astounded at what you get for $35. Unless I counted wrong, it was 11 items (consisting of nigiri, maki and tamago) plus miso soup, with one of the maki being an option between uni and ikura (my companion chose the sea urchin - I went with the fish eggs), and a final nigiri where the master gives you the option to choose any fish - mackerel lover that I am I asked for sanma (too early in the season) and settled for a beautiful piece of saba. My buddy went with a gorgeous piece of fatty tuna. Since this shop is right outside the old Tsukiji market, the fish freshness and quality is really high, and each piece had all the flavor and appropriate texture you could hope for.Tsukiji Sushidai Honkan is a huge tourist attraction and luckily I was able to find the correct one on Google Maps - there are a few places with similar names. After our Turret Coffee experience, my pal and I headed over to the sushiya and arrived just after their 11am opening to find that we'd missed the first seating. However, there were only two groups ahead of us, and we were seated within 10 minutes. The somewhat nondescript restaurant has three levels, each with a sushi bar; we were shepherded to the basement level, where there were two spots open at the counter.

On the whole the sushi was phenomenally good, but of course some pieces we enjoyed more than others. My favorites were the tuna which is simply indescribably delicious, so tender it just melts in your mouth without a hint of fishy taste. The wife loved the snow crab. Our least favorites were the octopus and for me the salmon, which was not as tender as the tuna. I added a couple of pieces of tuna to the chef's plate because it was so good. The experience was really fun, sitting at a counter and watching sushi be made and all the people. The service was excellent. The beers were super cold and delicious on a very hot day.

49,HARRY’S SANDWICH CO.,5,11,"[""Had a chance to swing by the new Harry's Sandwich shop located in Harajuku, right off of Cat Street a few days ago, which opened in early Fall. As many know, Harry's has some delicious sandwiches to offer (vegetarian and vegan options included) and its newest location is not only larger but seems like there are more items on the menu.It's been a while since I've been to Harry's and although I usually get the Buffalo chicken sandwich, decided to go for the sandwich that seems to be the signature item on the menu, the Meatball sub.It was tasty and filling, and may have replaced the Buffalo chicken sandwich as my go-to sandwich at Harry's.The contents of this review may be reflected on other review platforms I use.**** For more great places to enjoy international food and drinks in Japan, follow @gaijineatsjapan on INSTAGRAM **** And if you're on Facebook we have the Gaijin Eats Japan Facebook group as well: facebook.com/groups/gaij…"", ""The shop specializes in hot sandwiches. It's also one of the few places in Tokyo where you can get an honest to god meatball sub that is smothered with cheese. The meatballs are homemade and hearty enough to fill up your stomach but not too heavy to keep you bogged down. He also serves up a decent Cubano, and it's bound to make any meat lovers happy. Harry's other sandwiches are great too, and he often runs unique specials every week (the Honey Sriracha Chicken is another favorite of mine). During special events or holidays, he'll serve up unique dishes. If you're around in Harajuku for Thanksgiving, you should stop by for his Thanksgiving Sandwich. It is literally what you think it sounds like. Harry's shop is a cozy place that will remind you of a cafe in Potrero Hills back in San Francisco. Harry is a friendly guy who is always good for small talk or deep drunken conversations on life. It's always a great place to stop by to take a break from the bustling streets of Harajuku, or to just wind down from a long day's work. This is my opinion, but Harry's is one of the few places in Tokyo where people can just be themselves and meet other people who just wants to do the same. It's a home away from home."", ""HARRY's sandwiches is a place that is run by the nicest man.

The last time we were there harry deconstructed three sandwiches for us so that the 6 of us can all try three sandwiches right after having a fancy dinner.

50,Bistro Vingt-Neuf 29,5,1,"[""It's sometimes daunting the number of food options you have in Tokyo, but when it comes to really good lunch deals and delicious meat, I can't recommend Bistro Vingt-Neuf enough.This cute little bistro located near Nippori was where we had some amazing meat for incredibly low prices. Their ¥1000 lunch deals were what got me interested in the first place. With menu items ranging from Wagyu Cubed Beef to a Sirloin Rice Bowl, it was almost a steal.During the lunch hour, we were the only ones in the restaurant which made it a peaceful dining experience. The bistro was absolutely adorable and I loved their decor; there was even a small poster explaining the differences in coffee. I learned a lot just from that.Back to the food, each lunch set comes with soup, salad, and a drink of your choice. The wagyu cubed beef was one of the best meat dishes we had during our entire stay in Japan and at such affordable costs. We regretted not ordering a larger portion of meat because of how tasty it was. My sirloin steak bowl was also very good but the wagyu definitely takes it home.The entire experience was fantastic and I really hope they continue to do well in the dining scene in Tokyo.

We first got the five piece tuna and five piece shellfish. The tuna especially the toro just melts in your mouth. We also got the sea urchin which was slightly sweet and the octopus. I thought the salmon was solid too. The sushi was prepared expertly and with just the right amount of wasabi on it so that you don't destroy the flavor and can taste the freshness of the fish. The sushi chef who stood across from us was super friendly and joked around with us in English. I think his name is Diego and he's a homie.

Every now and then, the chefs make a call for special sushi such as otoro, aburi salmon, big shrimps, hotate etc and you have to be quick to call for one as there're limited plates each time."", 'The sushi here is *so* fresh and delicious! There are so many different varieties that it\'s difficult to keep from stuffing yourself; I was overly full but very happy. Our regulars (maguro, tobiko, ebi, ikura, sake, unagi, and inari) were terrific, as expected, but all the others we had were wonderful, too. I especially loved the grilled eggplant with miso sushi. The surf clam was also great. We had to have a couple of orders of each item and by that time, I was stuffed! They also offer fried chicken, noodles, desserts, and other items in case you don\'t want sushi. \xa0This ""conveyor belt"" restaurant offers great sushi at a reasonable price. Our bill came to about 4250 yen and we had 16 dishes plus green tea. Most dishes ran about 143 to 250 yen, with the most expensive, the surf clam, at about 465 yen; each order had 2 pieces. You can take the sushi from the conveyor belt or you can order whatever you want from the sushi chefs or other staff. If you special order, they\'ll make it and hand it to you. You make your own cup of green tea with the powdered matcha at your table. There\'s a hot water spigot at each table; I\'m not sure how it is if you sit at the counter. You can also help yourself to as much pickled ginger as you want.I would suggest getting there before 11:00 a.m. There was a line of about 24 people waiting at the bottom of the escalator when we arrived; they didn\'t run the escalator until close to 11:00 when the shops and restaurants inside the Kitte building opened. Most of the people in line were also headed to Nemuro Hanamaru, but we were able to be seated during the first round. If you don\'t make it for the seating, there\'s a check-in machine to the right of the entrance; be sure you sign in to hold your spot!', ""Hanamaru is a recent addition to the Tokyo area. This chain started in Hokkaido by someone who was in the fishing industry. There are two locations in Tokyo; since I was meeting someone at Tokyo Station, I decided to check out the KITTE Department location.As others here have mentioned, the line is massive! I waited for two hours; you read that right - two hours/120 minutes. The sushi was excellent though. They use very fresh and generous portions of fish. Prices vary from 130 to 400 yen so you get bang for your buck. You're not limited to what is on the roller; you can also order. Just grab the pen and paper at your table and write what you'd like. You can also indicate if you want wasabi or not.As per usual, you get amazing Japanese service.Although I enjoyed my experience, I'm torn as to whether I'll be back. Two hours is an abnormal amount of time to wait. Good for: sushi PS - There is an English menu. I'm not sure if the staff speak English, but I'm sure you can just point if need be."", ""This was my 3rd time having sushi at Nemuro Hanamaru. On my first visit to Tokyo, I found this place on Yelp and LOVED it. The sushi chefs stand in the center of the room and continuously place fresh plates of sushi out. You're also given a menu with numbers that correspond to photos of sushi that you can order by writing the numbers on a slip of paper to be handed to the sushi chefs. One of my favorite treats is the container of matcha tea powder available so you can drink an unlimited amount of complimentary tea. Each table has a tap for boiling water for the tea. I drank a LOT of tea!!When I ate here the last 2 times for lunch, I thought this place was phenomenal. On this visit, we waited 1 hr and got seated at 9PM. The selection wasn't as great as when I was there the last time...I'm not sure if it's because there wasn't as much of a selection late into the evening or if it's because I've eaten a lot of really great sushi since that first visit.I'll definitely be back, but I don't think I would be willing to wait 1 hour again."", 'Delicious kaiten-zushi for an amazing price! Located on the fifth floor of Kitte Shopping Mall. Our party of 11 waited about 40 minutes on a Monday at around 6:30pm, and got seated at two separate booths. Quality was amazing, generous fish portions, and very fresh for great prices, and service was very quick and speedy. There were many choices that you could choose from, by either taking it off the belt or ordering off a paper which you hand to the sushi chef.', ""Nemuro Hanamaru was recommended to me by a friend who was born and raised in Tokyo, so I knew it had to be good.When you're on vacation, time kind of blends together and you just kind of eat when you're hungry. \xa0Unfortunately, we were hungry at 7PM on a Saturday and got stuck in the dinner rush.About 45 minutes to an hour later, we were finally seated and starving!  There's a ton of sushi on the conveyor belts, each one looked even more delicious than the previous. \xa0The only problem was that everything was naturally in Japanese, so it was like playing a guessing game with each dish.Our best bet was to order off of the menu. \xa0The first column is the item number, the second is how many you want, and the third indicated whether or not you want wasabi. \xa0Then you hand your completed form to the sushi chefs and wait in anticipation.We decided to go for it and had a few things that we recognized. \xa0The first nigiri--this delicate orange striped piece of salmon--brought a smile to both of our faces. \xa0This was going to be a good meal.Each piece of fish was so fresh, the rice was the perfect flavor and texture, and the wasabi added the just the right amount of heat. \xa0We ate a lot. \xa0Plate after plate, they stacked up high. \xa0I looked at those plates and imagined what the total might be, we easily thought $150 or more.When we called it quits, they tallied our total and told us to pay up front. \xa0Our meal came out to $65 USD. \xa0SIXTY-FIVE DOLLARS. \xa0My gawd. \xa0At that moment, we decided we had to come back again. \xa0And we did, with a third person, and our total was only $80--no tip. \xa0If I lived in Tokyo, I'd be here every single day. \xa0I miss this place already."", ""Amazing sushi and great atmosphere! If you're going for lunch, the line typically starts on the first floor near the escalator around 10:20am on weekdays and they'll start the escalator at 10:52am. The elevator will not take you to the other floors before the people in line have reached the top floor. The restaurant has instructions on how to eat, order and serve yourself in English and even though they're adding new dishes to the conveyer belt constantly, I recommend ordering sushi directly from the chefs. This is probably the best sushi I've ever had and we'll definitely come back next time we're in Tokyo!"", ""3 hours wait...and I arrived 15 minutes after they opened for lunch. There was a line of 15 people waiting to put their name on the list at the kiosk so you have to wait in line to get onto the wait list. If you have a Japanese cell phone number, you can register your phone number to get a text but since I don't, I got a number and had to listen out for it. The kiosk is in Japanese only but if you can't navigate it, there is an attendant standing nearby to help.When you sit down, there are little papers for you to order what you want. You can't read the Japanese menu and can't write the item names in Japanese? Not to worry, you can ask for an English menu, which comes with pictures and the number for each item. You can simply write the item number in the slot and put the quantity to the right. You can then hand it over to the sushi chef.You can put as many items as you want that fits on the paper and repeat the process until you can't eat anymore. The items are reasonably priced but I honestly was not impressed with the taste. The rice was a little too vinegary than I would like and some of the fish was not served at the right temperature. Some of my orders came with really cold fish. This is probably due to the fact that they are super busy so they turn fish so quickly.I ended up eating about 12 dishes, which was a lot but not more than the average of what other people were ordering. The damage came to about $60 USD. I can't say I'm impressed with the food though and for the wait, I probably would not visit again.""]"

The spice was spicy enough to give me tingling sensation on my tongue and there was proper amount of ground beef for satisfaction. Egg plant is perfect match with the meat and the sauce, it was almost as satisfying as eating meat. I think if there was such a thing as eggplant steak, I think I can be a vegan for at least a month.

The food was amazing and it had such elaborate selection from tempura, smoked duck, sashimi, fresh salad, pickled veggies, black cod, and steamed egg.

This seemed like one of the best options as it is near a landmark, we could go for lunch, and it offered traditional seating and menu options. We both got the single layer bento box and it was more that enough food for us. The food was made up of a mix of seasonal ingredients and was delicious. The service was great, the tea was comforting, and the husband and wife management team provided a high level of service and atmosphere. We did not have any problem communicating. The music was fabulous! They walked us through the different types of shamisen music they were playing and there was the most beautiful singing. \xa0It was a rainy Tokyo day but this lunch was the perfect respite from the crowds and cold weather.

59,Fire House,4.5,30,"[""As many Tokyo Yelpers might know I cycle around Tokyo quite a lot so places that seem out of the way if you take the subway/train become the destination of my riding shenanigans!I'd read about Firehouse in Timeout Tokyo burger listings and first came across the store while riding with a friend. Today was my third visit and after a 14km ride (about 40-45mins) boy was I hungry! \xa0First things first THEY HAVE MILKSHAKES!!! \xa0Chocolate milkshake served in glass, not a metal milkshake tumbler but pretty good. \xa0Lunch Monday to Friday 11:00-16:00 \xa0they offer discounts for lunch sets on extras such as drinks, soups and desserts (milkshake not included!) making lunch better value. Expect to pay ¥200-¥300 for drinks.Burgers range from ¥990 up to ¥2180 (Mad Burger - 3 patties!) served with French fries that are a good thickness and a small portion. \xa0I like leaving the chips towards end as the juicy goodness dripped from the burger add to the tastiness!Last tip - get here before 12pm or after 1pm to avoid the local lunch rush."", 'I wouldn\'t say that Firehouse really aces anything but they consistently avoid mistakes and end up with a solid product and experience. Is that damning with faint praise? Perhaps, but it still gets four stars because almost all burger places somehow fail to live up to that standard. Strangely, I was most impressed by their onion rings. I didn\'t enjoy them the most per se but they are a great example of my previous point. They aren\'t greasy, don\'t loose their insides, and stay ""crackly crunchy"" even after sitting. I think this is due to panko being added to the battering process as the crunch is very similar to kaki fry or tonkatsu. They were great straight up, which is convenient because I didn\'t get any sauce. I saw another review mention a tartar sauce-like ranch but I saw not trace of it.Some more details they get right:*crunchy bacon. Oh, how I hate the ubiquitous floppy bacon of Tokyo! Though it is called a ""hamburger"", I don\'t want ham on it. \xa0*nicely textured bun. It doesn\'t fall apart and balances a bit of chew with tender texture. *not over-cooked.*service was good (though that almost goes without saying in Tokyo)Some things not quite as good:*milkshake tasted sour and was a bit small for the price. The glass it is served in is a tapered glass like I\'ve drunk a Bellini out of before rather than the round bottomed glass you associate with milkshakes/sundaes.*seating is relatively limited \xa0*pickle has no spice/herb flavor *Sicilian Lemon gelato is not gelato. It is a sorbet. It is, however, tasty. My one bite of the mushroom mozzarella burger was nicely creamy. My bacon cheese (American) burger was more acidic with the added mustard and ketchup but it had some kind of mayo based sauce as well. (Maybe that was the fabled ranch). Quality wise they passed the Freshness Burger test, which strangely most gourmet burger places don\'t, leaving me wishing I had just had opted for the cheaper and more convenient option. I missed out on the fries as I had subbed the spiced chips on my dish and my wife decided to copy me at the last minute. Despite this being a very American restaurant, these are not American ""chips"" but rather more akin to a skinny version of the British fish accompaniment with a higher crisp-to-fluff ratio. As far as location and transportation, a few people have mentioned it\'s a bit inconvenient but check Google Maps for bus routes because it is located a minute from Masago Sakue (yes, I checked the proper reading: まさごさかうえ- 真砂坂上) on the 上６９ that runs east-west from Ueno past Takadanobaba to 小滝橋車庫前. It also runs past Edogawabashi, where I have gotten off to go to Martiniburger. Lucky you, you don\'t have to go to Martiniburger since you can just stay on the bus and go to Fire House instead and save yourself the 10-minute walk, horrible sides, and constant bombardment of the promo video.Total was not too bad at ¥6000 for two burgers, tuna salad, large onion rings, Sicilian ""gelato"", and a milkshake, but no drinks otherwise.', ""I've had many burgers but the burgers here rank up there with the best ones I've had. \xa0As you approach the shop, you can smell the burgers bring grilled.

I also loved how the whole onion didn't come out when you took a bite. That irks me like no other!! Their ranch had an interesting flavor. Kind of tartar sauce-y flavored, but still had that ranch flavor as well. I surprisingly kind of skipped on it. Our burger came out and it was definitely huge! It comes with fries and a sliced pickle. We ate it pretty freakin' quickly and it was good! I definitely wouldn't say it's THE BEST burger, but a good burger nonetheless.

Oozey cheese, Japanese mayo, thick cut tomato and crunchy iceberg. Especially loved the tiny diced onion with pickle in there. The soft buns were definitely baked local, too. Southern inspired music and decor put an extra 'comfort' in this episode of 'comfort eating'.

That being said, when one place appears on almost everyone's suggestion list, I'll give it a try. Enter Ichiran. Ichiran was everything that was promised.

Wrong in terms of having to pay similar if not more than the Ichiran's I have dined at in New York. However, the ramen is just as good if not better.When an establishment draws line, it means that interest is high and the product with which they are selling is sought out for. I do have to say that this location is very easy to miss and I basically walked in circles before spotting their iconic logo. Since the entrance to this Ichiran is steeply burrowed, patrons are lined up on the adjacent sidewalk.I think we waited roughly 15-20 minutes before being seated. Once you get inside, you can then select your order directly from a vending machine. This is where my eyes widened for the higher than expected price tags. With that being said, while this is in no ways inexpensive, the ramen is totally worth it.Ichiran is known for their tonkatsu or pork based broth, and it is among the best of the best. You are given a slip to select how you want your ramen or the preferences set by the restaurant. We were given a fortune egg - which I don't know if it is different from their usual eggs but this one has a fortune sticker on it.

It definitely hit the spot for when I have a ramen craving but I probably wouldn't come back just because the wait was long for something that was just okay. I also tried the matcha pudding for dessert, and it was on the bitter side which was what I liked! But if you don't like bitter green tea flavor, it probably isn't for you. As you probably know, this place is known for their unique seating arrangement and ambiance. It's very tiny! So it's a place you want to go in quickly and get out quickly.

It was such a wonderful experience for me. I'd love to go back to Japan and visit again."", ""An absolutely amazing experience!! I can definitely see why Akiba Fukurou was rated the #1 Owl Cafe in Tokyo. The host & hostess were both extremely kind and made it their top priority to ensure you had the best experience (photos, handling, & meeting the owl of your choice) while also ensuring the safety and comfort level of both you and the owls. Each owl was exceptionally well trained to sit on its designated perch, was very well mannered and never for a second did I feel unsafe as long as I followed the guidance of the hosts.The cafe consists of three main spaces, with over 36 owls resting in several corners. Upon entering, the host explained the rules (versed in English & Japanese), then you're free to walk, touch, & take pics for 45 min. During that period, you'll also be able to pick two owls of your choice in which the host will use a DSLR to take and print photos for you as a parting gift. As an additional bonus, the host used to be a Wedding Photographer so he truly knows how to capture the perfect angles and moments. Without a doubt I would come here again if not for the experience, definitely to support this local business as their care and love for their pets (take a look at their family tree on the website!) was truly beautiful, and their customer service was one of the best I've had. Thanks Akiba Fukurou and until next time!Price $22.00. Tip: wear clothes you don't mind getting popped on. It didn't happen to me but my little brother was not as lucky. These owls are well trained, but not that well trained ;)"", 'Really love this cafe. 10 people maxed per reservation of 1 hour. Owners are very friendly and the owls are all so cute. Owl will be back!', ""Out of everything I planned for myself in Japan, this owl cafe was one of the things I was most excited for. They did not disappoint!After spending a wonderful morning and early afternoon palling around Akihabara, we found our way here for our reservation. It's in a quiet alleyway where you wait outside until staff come to get you with other reservations. You'll go over the rules and enter when ready to a quiet and calm atmosphere. Owls will be either on their day off and not present, on break or present and able to touch and hold. Touching is very minimal with just a finger to the forehead, no petting! Staff will tell you if you're doing something wrong very kindly. You can choose two owls to sit with (separately). Staff will warm you of the demeanor of each. You can take a professional photo with one of them. I chose a beautiful barn owl, White Bait and was told she is active and likes to poop! This was very true, promptly at 1pm. She also sat on my head and flew away from me. The staff are saints trying to manage so many owls and humans! My second owl also sat on my head (and pooped..), they are ok with them doing that as well as sitting on your shoulder which surprised me. The owls really seem happy and content. At 2000 yen, you get way more than your money's worth, I would easily pay twice that for this experience. It was so relaxing despite anxiety about owls flying away or fighting etc. It was my first time at an animal cafe and I was surprised there was no drink involved but I get it!They have very cute souvenirs and are cash only, I wanted to buy everything.You do get a souvenir photo included in the cost, it's a laminated photo of you and your chosen owl!My partner enjoyed the day experience much more than he thought he would, he asked for calm owls"", ""Love this place! Came with my husband (made a reservation a month in advance and they were pretty flexible when we had to switch a time slot) in the morning. You pay when you walk into the cafe. It's not a real cafe. You dont get to buy drinks or food. You're just there to enjoy the owls. They had many different owls perched around the place. The workers explain to you how to pet the owls and to be quiet. After the explanation, you get roughly 45 minutes to walk roam around freely and pet owls and take pictures. Each person gets to pick 2 owls to hold on their arm. The workers also help you take photos with their professional camera and print one out for you at the end to take home. The owls all seem pretty happy and well trained. Some owls really like the interaction and climb all over your arm, to your shoulder then up your head. I picked a white owl that liked to stand on my head. After a couple minutes, one of the worker said that it was almost time for this owl to poop soon. I said I didnt mind so I continued playing with it. Lo and behold, the owl pooped on me several minutes later. Luckily he was standing on my arm/shoulder and pooped on my leg, and not my head.Even tho I got pooped on, I had a great time here. I would definitely come back again. The owls all seem well taken care of."", ""If I could give this place 6 stars, no, 10 stars, I would! \xa0This place is incredible! \xa0You have to make a reservation. \xa0It is a quiet business on a side street but very easily found with google maps and taking the metro. \xa0The married couple that takes care of these animals and informs you about the cafe when you arrive are so professional and kind. \xa0Owls have to stay in calm, relaxing environments, so if you feel like you can't talk in a whisper and walk tenderly, then you probably want to go to a cat cafe instead. \xa0I would say this cafe is more for adults or maybe older teens. \xa0The couple speaks english as well for english speaking guests. \xa0This is such a magical cafe and should be on your list when you go to Tokyo. ^_^"", 'A must do in Tokyo!! Very nice staff, a very unique experience. They even take pictures with their professional camera and send them to you via email in addition to 1 laminated picture. I highly recommend', ""This owl café was one of the main highlights of our Japan trip thus far. It was such a memorable and unique experience to be able to interact with such cute/majestic owls. We made reservations about 1.5 months ago as time spots tend to fill up quickly. Before entering the café there is a seating area with instruction booklets on how to behave while you're inside. When one of the workers brought our group of three in, we were actually the first ones to be there in our time slot. We were able to use our full 45 minutes there wisely. During that time, we got to hold onto various owls (up to 2-3). The owls could remain perched on your arm but there may be cases that they find your head more comfortable instead. It was so cool being close up to all the owls and being able to touch the majority of them. It appears that the owls are very well behaved and properly taken care of by the owners. In addition to holding the owls, we also had our pictures taken as well! At the end, we received complimentary photos of us and our owls. Overall, this is an experience that I'd highly recommend to anyone visiting Japan!"", 'Absolutely wonderful time at the Akiba Fukurou Owl Cafe in Tokyo! The staff was professional, kindhearted, and extremely warm. They handle the owls with such care and attention which made us feel very comfortable and safe. The owls themselves were so cute!

However, it worked in our favor since this location on the 6th floor just opened up recently, so it was far less crowded than the Tokyo station location.Although Rokurinsha is famous for its ramen, I've never had tsukemen before, so my eyes gravitated to trying something new.

The ramen is served cool and in a separate bowl as the dipping sauce. The dipping sauce is very concentrated and thick - perfect consistency to stick to the noodles. To be honest, I think it was probably the best ramen I had during my entire 2 week trip - despite the fact that it's not what people would normally think of when they hear the word ramen. We arrived around 6:30pm and waited about 15 minutes. There are a few chairs to sit on while you wait, but not if you come later on. You order your food via ticket machine and then give it to your waitress as you're seated. Drinks and chopsticks are self-serve and you'll receive your ramen within 10 minutes. There are baskets underneath the counter for your shopping bags, which was super convenient. When you're finished with your noodles, you can request that they add broth to your leftover sauce so you can drink it. We were both so full from our noodles that we didn't opt for it. By the time we left about 30 minutes later, the line was probably 30 people deep so definitely come early.

75,Tsukiji GINDACO Don Quijote Akihabara,4.5,16,"[""No one ever thinks much of chain stores, right? Think again! Gindaco is takoyaki king! On our recent trip to Japan we hesitated to try out this shop as we would be going to Dontonburi in Osaka later. There's always some big shop that's either a hole-in-the-wall or legendary to all the locals. Well, I went all the way to the home of takoyaki in Osaka and tried many different kinds from stands all down DTR and Old Osaka. You'd think with all their awards and celebrity photos pasted on the outside that the food could hold up on it's own, but these octo balls fell flat. Literally. Deflated, mushy, with no balance.For me, skip Osaka if you're going just for takoyaki. I mean... If you skip Osaka, you could put that train ticket money into getting all the yummy octo-balls you want from Gindaco! The takoyaki from Gindaco are so crispy on the outside with a delicate and balanced chewy and nicely textured inside. The octopus bit on the inside is just the right size and the toppings don't deflate or flatten the takoyaki like I've seen happen from most takoyaki vendors. They came out presently so beautifully, with the toppings arranged just right. Since the Gindaco chain are stands, you can only take the food to go, but we found steps near an arcade and chowed downOut of all the different takoyaki I've tried in my life, these stood out from all! These were so good that sitting on the floor in the chill of the night melted all away and the takoyaki melted in our mouths. Just one last tip...let those babies cool off first or it will be your mouth that is melting."", ""After our nature stroll, my siblings and I headed over to Akihabara for some shopping. Once we got off at the stop, we passed by Tsukiji Gindako Don Quixote Akihabara, so we stopped to get some takoyaki. Stephanie S. and I really enjoyed them last year at the Shinjuku station, so we knew these were legit. Since this one was just a food stand and not an actual restaurant, lots of people were just buying an order and sitting on the side of the streets to enjoy it. Perfect contrast of the cooked batter on the outside and delicious gooeyness inside. There are 8 pieces per order, so we each got 2 takoyakis... definitely should've ordered more!"", ""Takoyaki, no care... croissant taiyaki only please! This is basically a giant, flaked pastry with the imprint of a fish on it and a brushing of some syrupy-soy saucy glaze. Bought one for 210 yen and it wasn't anything I was expecting. Fairly crunchy, but not so reminiscent of a croissant. It reminded of something, but I couldn't quite put my finger on it. Red bean filling made up for any confusion as that aspect was very familiar. 'Croissant' was rather large and therefore pretty good value for 210 yen. Sharing encouraged!"", 'I ordered the original it was fresh pipping HOT and delicious!! There were 8 Takoyaki balls.

My friends and I decided to stop here for a evening snack and we split a regular takoyaki (8pcs for ¥550). The octopus balls were large and hot, and it came with the standard toppings such as takoyaki sauce, small green flakes, and bonito flakes. The inside of the takoyaki was very flavorful and mushy, while the outside batter layer was firm, which fit my preference.Aside from selling the regular standard takoyaki, they also have options for additional toppings such as green onions, cod roe, and cheese omelette.', ""This was my first taste of authentic takoyaki made in japan. \xa0All my previous tastings were in the states and that never convinced me to love those balls(even when they were sold at japantown).Tried this place because we were so mesmerized at the whole production from start to finish--} batter to ball. \xa0The swiftness of how the employee pours the batter into the individual round molds, gently drops a fat piece of octopus, and swirls the batter with only long toothpicks to create the perfect balls. When I initially traveled to Japan for vacation, my plan was to eat takoyaki from foods stands, where the aunties are making them. \xa0This however is actually a storefront window. \xa0No seats. \xa0You buy and go. \xa0You can eat by the sidewalk as you please, which is what we did like the locals. \xa0They offer different toppings, but we tried just the plain ol' simple version with bonito dancing on top with seaweed flakes. \xa0My first bite was ah-maze-ing! \xa0Crisp shell, soft and gooey center with a chunky octopus diamond in the center. \xa0They don't skimp on the piece either. (Back in the states you'd be lucky to even find an octopus.) \xa0It was flavorful and piping hot. \xa0After a week of trying other takoyaki food stands, we came back to other gindaco shops located conveniently whenever I was craving it in tokyo. \xa0I had it at least three more times after being disappointed with other places. \xa0Other shops made it goey and didn't have that perfect crispy outer shell that I liked and didn't hold it's shape after the first bite- it would become a pile of goo. \xa0As much as I don't like supporting chains, I'm glad they are located in many places throughout japan because they can consistently create a perfect product. \xa0They churn new balls every time so you will hardly get takoyaki that are more than 15 minutes old.The tradition of making takoyakis need to be fresh and personally handmade-- I don't think I could ever enjoy a takoyaki made in the States ever again( because half the time it's frozen and they just fry it up.) :("", ""We had takoyaki maybe 6 times during our trip to Japan, and none was as good as the takoyaki at this stand!!!

Actually all the workers were preeetty good at English so if you\'re a noob at Japanese you may be ok.As for the meat, I can\'t remember exactly what cuts we ordered, BUT there was one that stood out a lot. Look for the meat that says ""Jumbo Original"" and ""sukiyaki style"" at the top of the meat selection page. Ok just looked at the English menu and it says Nohara-yaki. ORDER IT! It\'s marinated thinly sliced beef - the server will grill it for you, roll it up, then dip it in the raw egg (that you mix yourself) and then you eat it......... HOOOOOLY. It\'s so juicy and flavorful and omgggggggggg I loved it. Seriously delicious.As for the other cuts, I think everything was bomb. I remember we ordered galbi, tongue, several other ones, and we did not have any bad pieces of beef. Honestly so tasty, every single one.We also ordered one omurice, which was SO GOOD. And it was perfect to share as a rice dish, although my bf got plain white rice for himself as well.As for price and stuff, it cost us about $50+ per person/$100 total, at least if you count in dollars lol and that shit changes constantly. Actually it was more I think. Bring at least 10K Yen if you\'re dining for 2 but that\'s probably not gonna get you very full. Maybe bring 15K lol. We were like full but with room for dessert still lol.Service was good, price was very reasonable (especially for the quality of meat.. I mean wagyu beef ain\'t cheap yo), and food was fantastic. I recommend to all!', ""This was my first time experiencing yakiniku, and it did not disappoint. My boyfriend and I were visiting tokyo and our friend took us here and his friends ordered everything for us so I can't list the items we got... all I know is that every item was so perfect and delicious. Our server was so attentive to us and he cooked every piece of meat for us. It was honestly really interesting to watch, he explained how the meat was supposed to be cooked for a certain amount of time for each side. Hands down the best meat I've ever experienced. So good!!"", 'This place is one of finest meat grill restaurant.

This place is nice and very Americanized. Most of the staff can speak English very well. Service was excellent. We walked in at 7:21 and they sat us within 5 mins without a reservation. They did tell us that we must be done by 9... Which was fine bc we are fast eaters. There must have been a reservation at 9 or they were closing at 9. On to the meat review. It was good. But not as good as the last place i ate at. I asked the waiter (just bc I\'m not knowledgable with these meats) if this was Kobe, he said no, it\'s better then Kobe. I asked what is it and he said wagyu. I think the menu said black wagyu. Doing a quick Google search, google said black wagyu is classified as Kobe. So I don\'t know... Anyways, \xa0we tasted several meats and none really compared to the last meat restaurant I reviewed. (Look at pictures to see which ones we tried. None really ""melted"" in our mouths. They were tender and tasty but not compared to the last place. For a couple of the meats I had to add salt or us a dip. Price was pricey. I feel like we had less food and we paid around 4,000¥ more. As we walked around the area, we realized it was a wealthy area because of the cars and houses, which makes sense for the pricing... **** my wife just informed that the other steak house was in Osaka, I forgot it was in Osaka and not Tokyo. It\'s been a long trip! Lol so I\'m not really comparing apples to applesStill worth a try. There is an option where you go with the waiters recommendation. I wish I knew this and would have gone with this option. He said it would have been around 8,000¥ but we do not know if it was per person or total. We didn\'t ask because we were finishing our last plate of meat.', ""Food and service were both good. Quality of ingredients was fantastic. A little touristy - there were definitely more tourists there than locals - but maybe it's because it's a fairly residential area and the people there weren't prepared to pay $20 for one slice of beef bbq \xa0price is ok for ny standard but probably seem more expensive for most others.

Japanese bbq anywhere else will never be the same. Their meat were all premium, and they tell you how long you should grill it for so it is medium rare and cooked to perfection before you take a bite. Among 6 people, the bill was around 400, which isn't bad for premium meat! My favorite was the large thing piece that I took a photo of, but unfortunately don't remember which part it is. But you can't go wrong with any of the wagyu or anything else. We had the spicy noodles, and the cold ramen. I liked the spicy noodles a lot more than the cold (a bit bland). I also had the mango juice, which tasted very watered-down, but I guess it's because the ice cubes were melting next to the grill. I tried my friend's apple juice, and it was way better!At the end of the meal, you MUST order the ice cream! It is amazing.. so amazing my friends ordered another one! The cookie crumbs at the bottom of the ice cream mixed with the delicious milky ice cream made it the best thing to ever go in my stomach! I would go back there just for the ice cream if I could hah. But seriously, everything was so good here that it is worth going to in Japan - they have a few other restaurants too. Be sure to reserve because this place gets booked quick, or do as we did - go at 5pm and got seated right away. Decor was also very nice and has a large sitting around for people who needs to wait. Will be back for sure when in Japan! :)"", ""The best bbq meat I have ever eaten my entire life. My father in law ate here and said it's the best meal he was ever eaten ever. I suggest to do Omasake. I can't wait to come back here again this year taking my siblings with me. The meat quality is superb and literally melts in your mouth. It is quite expensive though, so be prepared to pay a high price for this meal. Won't recommend it if you are on the budget.""]"

Wish we had these restaurants near me....', ""Yoshinoya is a large Japanese chain, most prominently known for serving thinly sliced gyudon beef simmered in a savory herb miso soy broth with yellow onions and served over steamed rice. Unagi is another popular option in lieu of the beef. And accoutrements include a raw egg, kimchi, miso soup, scallions, etc. It's one of the best value meals you can buy in Japan. It's a simple, yet effective, meal. Rich thin slices of beef steeped in an intense umami sauce. Little fatty bits that give it a nice chew. And well complemented by the sweetness of the onions. As you mix the raw egg into your bowl, the egg intermingles with the residual beef bits and the sauce, and you're left with a perfectly flavored bowl of rice. It's nothing fancy and is a very common fast food chain across Tokyo, but if you're looking for a value meal and are craving meat, it's an easy convenient option."", ""Yoshinoya in Japan is nothing like Yoshinoya in the States! If anything I would have to say Yoshinoya in Japan almost puts the Yoshinoya in the US to shame.What is similar to Yoshinoya in Japan is the fair prices. It's definitely a value for your money eating here just like it would be in the US. What is different is the food itself. The food is actually served in real bowls versus styrofoam and they have waiters who bring the food out. The menu too is quite larger that what you find in the US. They have various rice dishes that come in combos with hot tea.I chose to get a gyodon, beef bowl with raw egg. The raw egg comes separate and they give you a bowl which can drop over your beef bowl to allow the egg to fall and cook. It's pretty neat to see this in Yoshinoya! I really enjoyed the hot tea they served with everything. It really felt like I was eating at an authentic Japanese restaurant. Overall this was a good, unexpected experience!"", ""Being a fan of Yoshinoya from the States, I was excited to give them a try in Japan. \xa0Unfortunately, I was a bit underwhelmed. \xa0Perhaps my expectations were a bit too high, thinking there would be a big difference between what was served here to what I get at home.The beef bowl is pretty much the same. \xa0Maybe a slight edge goes to this place for the marinade being a bit stronger. \xa0But as far as the meat, onions, and rice, it's the same quality. \xa0The miso soup was weak too, but so are the ones back home.Would I go back to a Yoshinoya in Japan? Probably not. \xa0Would I continue to go to the ones back home? For sure!"", ""I was going broke eating at all these different restaurants in Japan and trying out all these darn cute desserts.There is actually a Yoshinoya next to the place I am staying at, but due to the mentality that a lack of adventure = food isn't as good-- means traveling all the way here to find something to fill your belly with....I really wanted to come in here because 1. I see meat on the menu and I AM WEAKKKK FROM THE LACK OF MEAT and 2. the price is right baby!!I figured that this is a chain restaurant as they all have the same layout and can fit about 8 - 10 people at once. You basically sit around a U shaped table with one wait staff inside the U taking orders, giving out dishes, and receiving money for the bill. Given that the menu is very simple, it is needless to say they should have their food down to a simple process. And my friends, not only was the price right, the food was more than just tolerable-- this could potentially be food that I will be eating for the rest of my trip since I have been going brokkeeeee. I mean, come on, 5 - 6 dollar meals that will FILL MY BELLY (I actually couldn't even finish my meal, I went nuts and ordered a large), count me in!You can choose between a pork dish or a beef (fatty beef to be specific) dish.

They have some decent sets. I got a veggie set with kimchi, rice and miso. I was in need of some kimchi and it hit the spot.

From the moment that the guide and the plated food is presented, a foreshadowing of sorts comes into play. This is quote smart and creative, and I highly commend the thought process that has gone into the ensuring of a satisfying customer experience. Now talking about the beef alone, each way you cook it, whether just for a light searing, or if you prefer to have a golden brown colour, the tastes changes as well.

I probably could have had a third if there was more yam and gyukatsu! Amazing experience!!!!!"", ""It started to rain after walking back from Tokyo SkyTree and I didn't feel like having fast food, so I decided to wait it out here. Luckily, there was no line, so I took the narrow staircase down where only four other diners were eating.The whole gimmick of gyukatsu is that a premium steak is flash-breaded so it's still rare underneath, and the diner can then finish cooking it to their preference on a hot stone plate with various accoutrements to flavor it like rock salt, wasabi, sauce, and the like. The set also includes rice, cabbage, potato salad, a bowl of red miso soup, and a side of grated yams.For those of you who don't speak Japanese, don't fret. There's only one thing on the menu and only in multiple portion sizes, so the only thing you need to decide is how hungry you are and how much delicious beef you can eat.

So we took place amongst the other patrons and waited patiently to be seated. A woman come out from the restaurant with a menu and proceeded to ask each person in line what they wanted from the menu. When it finally got to us, I was filled with joy because, there was only 1 dinner set to choose from so, that made communicating a lot easier(comes with cabbage, roe, katsu, potato salad, miso soup, purée yams, wasabi, and sauces) the next choices we were presented with was the amount of meat(130g or 230g) and drinks. All in all it's a great place to have dinner when in Asakusa. The concept of cooking your own food on a tiny stone stove is delightful and a must-do!! Enjoy!!!""]"

There was one open table the entire time I was there, so I think it's possible for lunch time to not have a reservation (if you're willing to sit Japanese style instead of at a table).All of the food was incredible. I had the hone (fried eel's bone) to start, which was interesting and delicious, though there isn't much to eat! Then came the umaki (eel egg roll), which was my favourite dish, combining two of my top foods in one and it didn't disappoint. The eel and egg complemented each other very well. The main course, unajyu (large) with kimosui (plain soup with eel's stomach), came next and did not disappoint. The eel was not covered in a ton of sauce like it is in Western culture, which I preferred. It had a distinct salty taste. It also came with delicious pickles. The soup was amazing! I can't even describe the taste but it warmed my soul. I had a cold, dry sake with the meal, which helped relieve any anxiety I was feeling!Overall, unbelievable experience.

Sure enough as I sat there waiting, a steady flow of people came in and were shown their seats or were told to come back in 30 to 45 min. I'd initially thought it was closed as the sign at the door indicated something was sold out. But I figured since I was already there I'd go in anyway and hopefully they can seat just one. Menu was simple with only eel. And eel ribs, eel bones and eel intestines. Not sure how these are cooked but I decided to go with the tamagoyaki and the regular sized unagi don. The omelette was absolutely delicious and cooked just enough to be fluffy and still juicy with the broth. They make orders only for 2 people and indicated it might be too much for just one. I went ahead anyway thinking I can bring the extra home. No regrets!The eel rice bowl came in a lacquered box together with a small bowl of pickles. Smelt great and smoky, with the eel flesh pretty much melt in your mouth tender. The sauce was just right and not the cloyingly sweet kind smothered all over and drenching the rice.

We had the tamago too, it was alright. I probably could've passed on that. Price 5/5: It's on the high side but it has a Michelin star so can't complain. Service 5/5: They were very attentive. The eel took slightly long but they may have been killing it in the back? I would imagine that if it tasted this fresh, they were doing something extra in the back to cook it.

I ordered: - Jyuu (regular sized) Unagi (suspiciously sold out of the small size I wanted..) - my favorite part of this was the rice, which was absolutely stellar. \xa0And as far as Unagi goes, this was obviously top notch. - yakitori - two skewers. I think thigh meat. \xa0Simple, delicious, and also not the reason to come here. \xa0It's an afterthought. \xa0 - umaki - tamagoyaki with eel in the center. \xa0Honestly, I would've preferred just the regular tamagoyaki. \xa0The portion is big enough for two, so if you're dining solo like I was, this might be too much. \xa0Final note - the people who operate this place are super super friendly and kind."", ""After seeing Hashimoto's video on YouTube, I knew I had to try this spot and boy I was not left disappointed.We came in at around 4pm and the owners almost didn't let us in because it was fully reserved for the night!The unagi was incredible, the fat from the fish complimented really well with their in-house sauce. The unagi were charred perfectly and had a great smokey flavour to it.They also had some type of mixed spiced pepper, it left my mouth a bit numb but I think the hostess was trying to tell wasn't for the fish haha."", ""I have to applaud my buddy Rod U for telling me about this jewel. \xa0The unagi was outstanding. \xa0The flavors were unreal. \xa0The unagi had texture and a nice smokey finish. \xa0It sat on top of hot rice with worked well with the unagi. \xa0We also ordered the unagi rib. \xa0The rib had more of a meaty taste. \xa0It was also amazing! \xa0The service was great and the workers were so friendly. \xa0We only paid with cash since they don't take credit cards. \xa0It was a little out of the way from the subway we took. \xa0But it was worth the walk. \xa0I hope to go back again, soon."", ""OPINION - Really liked this restaurant. We were able to get a table walking in (we were shocked!) but I think this is because we went for lunch. I think for dinner time it's better to make a reservation as I think it is very popular. The meal was on the pricey side but it was a very special experience (worth it!). SERVICE- The service was good. Waiters were very polite and accommodating considering our Japanese-speaking skills were limited. They were attentive and helpful.FOOD- The restaurant is known for their unagi (eel) and that was the main dish on the menu. I got the small unagi lunch box which large enough for me. The unagi was cooked and seasoned very well.""]"

Finally visited last night with my husband and 2 friends.Loved the thin corn tortillas used for the tacos! We tried carnitas, chorizo, shrimp and the Japanese beef kind. All were excellent and the size was akin to street taco size and price was on par with LA. The guacamole was quite good but pretty small hehe The corn was also very good. The interior was pure vibes - I hear she hired a Mexican artist to decorate and paint inside! So authentic! The window installation with the flowers and plans was also cute but failed to get pic bc patrons seated by it hehehe ~ thinking perhaps A seasonal tamale would be great for Xmas time and maybe also sopes would do well??? *hint hint* haha Seriously enjoyed our meal here! Great for anyone who loves Mexico or Mexican food! Service was also excellent!!! Gracias!!!!"", 'Portions are Tokyo size but the food is good and exceeded expectations! After eating ramen for days it was a nice change of pace at the end of our trip.', ""Great tequila selection much cheaper than the States.

Would highly recommend!"", 'Location is convenient as it\'s less than 10min away from Denentoshi line Shibuya station. And I can feel the owner\'s devotions to Mexico as soon as I walk in here and see all these decor. These definitely put you in a mood.Came here for Taco Tuesday, they were offering two tacos + corona for ¥1000. But I was really surprised how small tacos were. Apparently these are how they are in Mexico. I guess that I\'m accustomed to ""Tex-mex"" size, then..Size aside, fresh coriander and tomato were refreshing and rejuvenating, pork were quite juicy and flavorful. Obviously I wasn\'t full at all: I ordered another 5 tacos(¥1000). Hmmm... Still not enough.Maybe I should eat something heavier then...One last thing I can rave about is that two boys that night were putting some herculean effort to make the place run! Kudos to them!!']"
88,SMOKEHOUSE,4,39,"[""Being from Kansas City (USA) BBQ is our speciality, and after being in Japan for over a month I felt a bit home sick. \xa0Luckily for me I found SMOKEHOUSE BBQ. \xa0I was a bit nervous to try traditional American BBQ in Japan but I can honestly say this place delivered! \xa0The ribs were falling off the bone, the brisket and burnt ends were so juicy and had an amazing smoke flavor. \xa0The barbecue sauces were bold and packed with flavor. \xa0This place hit the spot for me on so many levels. \xa0It was a taste of home but mostly I was just pleased to find an amazing barbecue joint in Tokyo of all places. \xa0The first key that this was going to be a great spot was when I saw the chef/pitmaster who was smoking the meats had a sleeve tattoo of the Texas flag.I will say it was a bit pricey but I feel like the quality of food and atmosphere justify the cost. \xa0Not to mention it is in a pretty swanky part of the trendy harajuku neighborhood and just a quick walk from the lively Shabuya station. \xa0I'm so happy to have this place as one of my regular go-to restaurants when I am in town or playing tour guide to my friends and family. \xa0Even if you are local Smokehouse is great for getting an authentic and true American barbecue experience."", 'This place confused me, really... You generally come for the BBQ, which is all meat, but the sides are vegan?!?! I really enjoyed the BBQ, pricey as it was, but heck, it\'s Tokyo, and meat never really comes cheap. The coffee-rubbed brisket, WOW. Definitely coming back to order that again, and considering it\'s hard to find good American BBQ out here, this place fit the bill. I think when they created the menu for this place though, I do think they were trying to accommodate foreigners and expats. The salad we had ordered had tofu bacon for example, and I would have been much happier if there was no ""bacon"" in it at all at that point.. I also had a haunting suspicion that the macaroni and cheese was made vegan! By all means, I\'m not against vegetarian/vegan cuisine at all, in fact I like dealing out great vegan places. But I\'m not entirely sure vegetarians and vegans would go out of their way to visit a BBQ place with the intent on just ordering sides....To sum it up, I\'ll definitely be back, but I\'m just going to stick with the main course. Oh, can\'t forget the beer!', ""I thought this place gave me a great experience overall. So it's located in Harajuku a very nice area. They have an upstairs and downstairs seating area and bar. The interior is so nice and I loved the lights bulbs at the ceiling. The lighting was perfect and a great ambiance. I think this location would be nice with friends or a significant other.So I ordered the 3 combination plate with burnt ends ,spare ribs and pulled pork. It came with cornbread and coleslaw. I am not a coleslaw fan but this coleslaw was petty good with the dried cranberries in it. The cornbread was delicious and the ribs and burnt ends tender and juicy. The sauce that is already on the meat is pretty good. The pulled pork did not come with bbq sauce but they had about 4 sauces on the table in bottles that you can try. I favored the vinegar base and pepper one. I ordered the buffalo lemonade which is a whiskey based drink which I enjoy. My friend and I shared the pecan pie which was amazing and it came with ice cream and some whipped cream on the side. I definitely recommend this dessert. This location was surrounded by little boutique stores and right off the Main Street of high end stores. So it's a great location to eat and then walk around and do a little shopping. I gave it 4 stars because the seating was very crowded and they sit you right on top of eachother. I do understand it is japan and the spacing is limited but there were open seats in areas where people weren't sitting and they chose to sit us right beside a couple with no elbow room. We did request to move and they accommodated us. All in all I definitely recommend this location and would definitely go back."", 'Odd really. I eat BBQ all the time back in the states. Always looking for the best. I also NEVER eat non-local when abroad. Yet circumstances being what they were, i found myself saying ""f@#* it, I\'ve been passing by this place for years, I will try it.""Glad I did. No, I get it, one does not go to Japan to eat American cuisine, but trust me, if you are in Shibuya / Harajuku and want some ribs that are going to slide off the bone, if you want thick juicy cuts of brisket or bacon, or if you want the classic burnt ends... yup. This is your kind of place. Beers are excellent as well. If you aren\'t in Shibuya, make time to get over there!', ""Feeling some BBQ and seeing if Tokyo could muster up some real American style BBQ we headed out to Smokehouse. Though if being honest, it was because this was one of the only places open late night in the Omotesando area.In a nutshell, pretty pricey for portions. Food was good though! There were a few discrepancies here and there, but overall a pretty strong hit on flavor and texture so far from home.Really love the roasted veggies-- a mixture of sweet and salty. The pulled pork wasn't half bad either.Would definitely hit up Smokehouse again."", ""Staff is awesome, food is great, craft beer to make the experience better...what more could I want?Started with a house hefeweizen. \xa0Nice body and worth trying if you are a fan of this style. \xa0Also has the blond and the IPA.Ordered chili which was possibly the best chili I've had in years. \xa0Pulled beef, smokey, spicy...best of everything.Pulled pork sandwich was awesome as well. \xa0Perfect portion, topped with house slaw on a potato bun. \xa0I got the potato salad side and it was also good. \xa0Some people complain about portion size, but I was totally satisfied with my meal. \xa0Left feeling good, not bloated and uncomfortable...unless that's your thing.Good background music, clean bathrooms, quick service. \xa0We enjoyed every part of our meal."", 'Great location, great service and great bbq! The ribs were meaty and sauce just perfect', ""As a Northerner I won't claim to be an authority on what makes barbeque spectacular, but as a former resident of the South I at least have a general idea. American-style barbeque is hard to find in Japan, but this place hits the spot. Be prepared to pay more than you're used to back home, and also be prepared to receive smaller portions than you're used to. Service is excellent - I took my girlfriend here for a birthday lunch and the waiters were spectacular.In a nutshell: if American pricing and portions were offered, this place would be 5 stars. Otherwise, great food and excellent service!"", ""I love this place! It's a bit pricey but the portions are a good size. I haven't found something on the menu I didn't like. My favorite would have to be the pulled pork chili cheese fries. The salads are really nice as well. They have an assortment of different hot sauces for the meat and I had fun trying them all. Dessert was ok, so if you're too full from dinner I would just skip it. If you do want dessert I would go with the hot fudge sundae (it has candied bacon!). The place has a great atmosphere for dinner with friends. The decor is fun and gives you the feeling of being in an American restaurant. Great for people living in Japan who miss barbecue and the feeling of home."", ""I'm so glad I found Smokehouse. Good selection of beers, including a really good pilsner and a super-hoppy, Oregon style IPA. The pulled pork sandwich was good - not great. Seemed like the pork needed a bit more flavor. But it came with the best fries I've ever had. They were perfectly cooked, well salted, and very fresh. The service was really good too. I was at the bar and when the bartender was busy several other servers checked on me. So far this is the only BBQ I've found in Tokyo, but it did not disappoint.""]"
89,511,4.5,93,"[""I didn't realize you could leave Yelp reviews in Japan until today, so here I am. This is a pre-COVID experience. My hubby made reservations a day in advance online for lunch on a weekday and the Google translation feature worked pretty well for us. Upon arriving, we were greeted promptly and escorted to a nice corner table. I was so excited. We were looking to try some really good Kobe beef for my birthday while we were on vacation here and the google reviews for this place seemed promising. Taking advantage of the lunch special, my hubby got $50 USD Kobe round, and for me, the Kobe sirloin (something like $200 USD) The staff knew we needed an English translator and provided us with a waitress who could guide us through our experience. For those of us that aren't fluent in Japanese, it was nice to feel that you could enjoy a top-notch experience without skipping a beat from the language barrier. She explained that 511 was reflective of their seriousness to the quality of Kobe beef. The restaurant Kobe Beef Kaiseki 511 is particular about the quality of its namesake beef using only the choicest cuts of the highest A-5 grade beef that's scored an 11 out of 12 on the Beef Marbling Score. (Our waitress explained that they want 12, but there are too few cows to be able to serve at that level). For appetizers, we had a seafood salad that appeared very simple at a glance, but upon eating it, was explosive in flavor. You can tell they are very intentional about their arrangements. By the time our main course came out, we were eager to taste what up till then, was something we'd only heard about through TV shows and magazines. It definitely lived up to its hype! My Kobe sirloin was full of amazing flavor and melted in my mouth. It was the most tender piece of meat I've ever had. If I could describe what it tasted like, it was like a yummy piece of crispy fat cooked perfectly. Crispy on the outside, soft and buttery on the inside...except it was like that the entire cut. I still compare all pieces of steak to this experience and hope that one day we can go back and eat here again. It was very expensive, but we felt it was well worth both the food and experience."", ""They're in the upmost echelon on a number of review sites for Kobe beef in Tokyo.I traveled on a crowded train only to be initially turned away as I had no reservation. \xa0With a little pleading they sat me at 5:30 pm, the restaurant opens at 6:00 pm. \xa0The only caveat is that I had to finish in two hours, it took me 1:45.I was greeted by at least ten staff members. \xa0It looked like there was one server per table.I then got to choose my own sake cup from an impressive selection. The Kobe beef is A5 rated with a marbling value of 11. \xa0I have no idea what that means, but it's something exceptional in Kobe beef speak.I opted for the Complete Kobe-beef course and paid ~$32 extra to have it upgraded to their premium cut, the Precious. \xa0I like it a little fatty so I opted for the sirloin rather than the Chateaubriand (best part of the tenderloin.) I once did that before at Craft Steak in Vegas and it was the most memorable steak ever.Aside from the insanely tender beef it was the details that stood out. \xa0For example, red wine flavored salt. Different Wagyu sections of Kobe are included in the small dishes.What a memorable experience!"", 'What else can I say but the service but WOW. I approached the door, and it was slid open for me with a host saying ""welcome Vidovich party"". You will never find better hospitality or more incredible steak.

The food here is incredible and unlike anything I've ever tried. Textures and flavors are perfect.We did the Kobe beef complete 8 course dinner and it ended up being a good amount of food. Standout dishes were the Kobe beef nigiri, hearth baked Kobe beef steak, and the grilled oysters with mayonnaise. Dessert was this super refreshing pear jelly and grapes.Service is the best I've ever experienced. Fully staffed and ready to assist you for any request.Dinner was a bit pricey ($170) but well worth the experience!"", ""How on earth are there no Michelin stars yet for 511? \xa0I used OpenTable to book dinner for our final night in Tokyo for this restaurant in Akasaka that specializes in Kaiseki dinner using Kobe Beef as the main ingredient. \xa0Service, Food, and Presentation are all on par with 1 and 2-Michelin restaurants I have tried in the USA. \xa0Pricing for both a Kobe Beef Dinner and a Seafood/Kobe Dinner include service charge, tax, and two glasses of red wine was just over $300 US per couple.We enjoyed every dish:1. The first dish was a grilled Kobe beef with broad beans, bamboo shoots, and homemade soy sauce. The beef was so soft you can shred it with chopsticks and it was so juicy and savory.2. Next came the appetizer plate with pickled veggies, Kobe Beef with mountain yams, and some seafood goodies like sea bream sashimi and sweet shrimp. \xa03. My third dish was this clam and dashi broth with a seafood dumpling that's also stuffed with Kobe Beef. \xa0Supposedly you drink the broth, eat the solid food, and then drink the rest of the broth. \xa0I liked 511's version of this soup better than Kenzo Napa and Hasiri (SF) back home.4. Fourth dish was the tempura, which is also included with the seafood menu. \xa0That's a great thing since the Tempura is near perfect. We mixed all the minced radish, ginger, and wasabi in with the dipping sauce for the veggies and Kobe Beef. \xa0For the white fish, I used a pinch of salt and lemon. \xa0The fish was so soft and flakey that it nearly stole the show! \xa0We also liked how they used somebitter greens in the tempura to balance out the flavors a bit.5. Kobe Beef nigiri came next with beef from two different parts of the cow. \xa0Both were melt-in-your-mouth tender and went well with the loosely-packed sushi rice.6. The main course of 100g Kobe Beef Sirloin was a dish for the ages. \xa0Buttery, impossibly tender beef that's already perfect on its own. \xa0We also tried adding a bit of the Soy Sauce Mousse and Wasabi to the beef, allowed it to melt naturally from the temperature difference, and wow experienced even more umami if that's even possible. \xa0Probably one of the best pieces of beef I've ever had.7. Green Tea Soba Noodles was the final savory items to get some carbs in. \xa0Excellent noodles and dipping sauce, and I really liked how they snuck in some dried seaweed for more flavor. \xa0Seafood menu gets white rice, miso soup, and pickled veggies.8. Dessert was a three parter with a really soft and sweet green melon, red bean paste, and a soft banana cake. \xa0Its recommended to mix the last two.511 is definitely worth a splurge for dinner while in Tokyo, and the default 100g Kobe Beef dinner will leave you satisfied and not uncomfortably stuffed. \xa0Had I known the beef was so perfect I may have opted to pay extra for ala carte. \xa0Hopefully they can score some Michelin stars in the near future."", 'Overpriced chewy meat. I googled ""best kobe beef in tokyo"" and this place came up more than once. I am baffled. Came here for lunch and ordered Kobe beef 200g ($27000 Yen or about $250-$260 USD) and Wagyu beef 200g ($5800 yen or $50 USD). We were so hungry, our mouths were drooling with anticipation. When the meals came out, everything was so nicely placed and the food looked more elegantly dressed than us. My husband was filming me while I cut into the Kobe beef and to my surprise, it was hard to cut! I tried to make it look effortless (I mean..I am planning to put this on youtube and all) but it was not easy. I thought maybe it was a dull knife. I put the kobe beef in my mouth and I chewed....I chewed and I chewed and I chewed. It was chewier than I had thought it would be. I thought it was suppose to melt in our mouths. My husband and I were both disappointed. We thought the Wagyu beef was more tender than the kobe beef. I felt bad and gave half of my wagyu beef to hubby. I felt robbed. I couldn\'t leave Japan with a negative beef experience so I went to another beef restaurant in Osaka for $75 a person and it was WAYYYYYY better. This place is all hype.', ""We were visiting Japan for our honeymoon and we knew that we definitely wanted to try Kobe beef.After doing some research online, we found out that many restaurants don't serve authentic Kobe beef. 511 is one of the few places that did so we made a reservation through OpenTable.We arrived early on a Thursday night for our reservation and were seated right away. I was expecting a traditional restaurant, but instead it was a high end western restaurant. The servers were very attentive, courteous, and knowledgeable about their food.We chose to have the complete Kobe beef course served in the Japanese Kaiseki way.

It was like a breath of relief as you stepped in, away from all the noisy outdoor food vendors. This place does provide full English menus. There was no line as we went in for an early dinner. We ordered a warm soba set and a warm udon set. Many of the sets allowed you to choose between cold/hot (tsumetai/atatakai) soba/udon noodles. The broth was wonderfully warm and full of flavor. Their soba isn't the deep, rich type of buckwheat flavor, but it was lighter. My udon noodles were hidden under a layer of egg - and the diameter of the noodles surprised me when I first grabbed one! You can definitely taste the handmade-feeling from the udon. They were so thick that it was a little hard to grab a whole strand, as it liked to break off itself from the weight. It was unlike any kind of udon I had in the past. I think they served some sort of roasted buckwheat tea - which complemented the meal very well.

I\'d recommend ordering the edamame and the cool cucumbers to munch on while waiting for the meat. They\'re also great bites in between the meat skewers. The cucumbers are super refreshing and flavorful with the spice they put on it.Also, don\'t skip out on the potato croquettes!! So good and so fresh.', ""Was a little hesitant to find out Torikizoku was a chain, but in the end was really glad we gave it a try!Many of our yakitoris came out to 150 yen a dish. We ordered varied dishes, but the stand outs for me were the chicken hearts and chicken and chive yakitoris. Really can't go wrong with what you order, just pair it up with a drink and you should be good to go. There are lots of smokers here, and you can't really escape it, just a note there!"", ""Best yakitori from a chain. Definitely order the chicken & shiso tempura; it will be fried to perfection and delight you with its crispiness. Another option if you've never had yakitori is to try the chicken meatballs (Tsukune). Unfortunately there is no non-smoking section, so if you're very sensitive to this, I don't recommend it.""]"

For that reason, I\'m a huge admirer of the fictional character Goro Inogashira from the acclaimed series ""Kodoku no Gourmet"" for his ability to be able to willy-nilly find amazing culinary gems just based on instinct alone.In a world where so much information is available any time at the stroke of your finger tips, it\'s becoming harder and harder to resist the urge to know and understand more than meets the eye; but then it so happens that we\'re only human and sometimes even what seemed like the best of plans sound terribly mortifying the day after -- which is exactly what happened on this business trip.Whereas I had made grand plans to stand in line at yet another renowned ramen joint and spend my last early afternoon in Tokyo under the scorching 30 degrees Celsius sun, having consumed almost no protein over the past few days and filling my stomach with naught but rich ramen/soba broth, I was just about ready to throw up even at the thought of eating another bowl of ramen.But alas sometimes life does throw you a random gem and leave you unexpectedly and completely satisfied out of absolutely nowhere. I haphazardly entered this place on my way to Shimbashi dreading the thought of eating another bowl of ramen, and everywhere else in Tokyo station was bursting with people.To my surprise every item on the establishment\'s menu served the noblest cut of the cow: I opted for the Gyūtandon, which is prepared with steamed wheat, a yuzu-infused yet not so overwhelming shōyu-based tare, and a bed of thin-sliced chewy, soft, fatty, dreamy cow tongue.The ox-tail soup that comes with the set is a godsend, especially after long nights of drinking at Gremlin and waking up still drunk yet not hungover.

Other things I enjoyed during the meal included the ikura served with rice, the marinated tuna, and the negitoro handroll MMM. Also, I think I have a newfound love for mackerel. Horse mackerel though, that's my type, yup that's my type. Also, ikura tastes better here compared to home, and I ONLY eat tuna when I'm in Japan because elsewhere, it just tastes rubbery and fake. There weren't any pieces that the chef served where I didn't enjoy. I honestly loved everything down to the wasabi leaves that he gave me. Even the ginger tastes different lol. My two friends and I drank about 3 carafes of the house sake and our total came to about $80 USD a person. Without the drinks it would've been close to $60. DANG what a steal. I honestly don't think you can find a better deal here in Japan, and if you think I'm lying, then PLEASE tell me where I can. Make your reservations beforehand!

My favorite were the two types of uni and their clam soup was so nice and savory. Really enjoyed their egg custard pudding with yuzu on top. Not every course was a type of fish.

All fishes and dishes were fresh, so fresh we could taste the rawness. This restaurant did not gain my 5 stars on yelp because they put too much rice in each roll that it made me and my husband super full.

Plush toys, accessories, housewares, apparel, food and so much more line the store. I could not help but leave with several items for myself and for those that love Pokemon as well. There is also a cafe dedicated to Pokemon directly next door. I had not planned to even visit this cafe due to reviews of being overbooked and hard to get a seat.

I highly recommend the Pikachu curry and the gengar grape drink. Those were both really good. We also had the Jigglypuff dessert and it was good.

We were about 15 minutes late, but they were still able to accommodate us.For double the price of a regular and good-tasting meal, you can can an entree in the shape of a pokemon. I had the the Bulbasaur veggie burger and it was pretty bad. BF had the Pikachu curry, and he said it was worse than the supermarket curry powder that you'd mix with water. I was pretty much expecting this though. If you come here, it's not for the food but it's because you love the characters. They also have a giant gift shop, where you can find many pokemon plushes, and a lot of other random things that any Pokemon fan would love (but again, this comes at a price - seems like everything here is marked up).I wish it wasn't so gimmicky and they actually tried to put a little bit of effort into the food, and not just serve cute but bad-tasting stuff at a high price, just because they can.

However, looking at the same item on the Japanese menu made it clear that this was a meat burger with vegetables on it. That is so misleading to people who cannot read Japanese. Our server said the only things without meat were desserts and drinks. So while my friends got to enjoy hot curry, I ate a tiny cake. I was pretty bummed about it, even though the cake was adorable.

I ordered the pikachu curry plate and the seasonal cheesecake. The flavors of the dish were great but the presentation was superb! I love the pikachu shaped rice and cheesecake.

The medley of savory flavors balanced well with the perfect al dente noodles and the tender, succulent meat. The gyoza was crispy and had a 50/50 ratio of meat and dumpling wrapping. The beer was ice cold. We both inhaled of our bowls and sets (Akamaru for me, Karaka for my husband), which both came with gyoza, but the Karaka also came with soft boiled egg on top of rice.

The way it picked up the broth with every bite was pure bliss. The meat was so tender it just melted in my mouth. I personally like my order to be spicy so I added the red sauce you see in the photo and it added another depth of flavor to the already amazing broth. I also like how cozy and small the shop was.

TLDR; If we're just talking ramen, then go to Ichiran (especially if there's no line). I gave both restaurants 4 stars for different reasons, but the ramen at Ichiran is better simply because you get to customize everything. But it's not worth an hour+ wait in line unless it's your first/only visit. So Ippudo is a great alternative. PROS:-Little to no line during actual lunch hours (vs. an hour+ wait at 3pm on a weekday at Ichiran)-Ramen noodles are firm-Extra condiments at the table to add to your noodles: bean sprouts, cloves of garlic (which you grind yourself!), and pickled vegetables-Nice environment and attentive staff CONS:-Broth is flavorful but not rich-Can't customize spice level on any noodles except one dish (which is the main reason I ended up ordering it vs. the other options). FYI, I have a fairly high spice tolerance and got level 3. It had good flavor, but I didn't find it spicy. So if you want the heat, I suggest starting at level 4. Overall, it was a good experience.

I went for an *Akamaru Modern* miso styled ramen since that was what they were known for. You can order the base for 850 yen or with special toppings (add an egg and more meat) for 1080 yen. Broth was silky smooth with the depth and potential of a pork broth, but subtly salty and milky. They really pack on the pork slices to the max! And they were thick and fatty. Noodles again on the thinner side, but the appreciation here is for the broth and toppings. Spectacular!This place is a bit more 'hip' than most ramen restaurants I went to. They have a couple of motifs on the wall one of which contains a repeating pattern of ramen broth spoons. A must-try ramen chain? Certainly!

This particular branch is a bit different from the others as it has more sit down tables to cater to the large tourist crowds that are coming in for lunch after visiting Sensoji whereas usually, there are only solo counters for people to sit at. The process is pretty much identical though. You order at the vending machine at the front, get seated and fill out the piece of paper where you circle all the ramen preferences. If unsure, you can just follow the recommended preferences that are outlined in a dashed line. Everything usually comes out really quickly, but this place took a tad longer than usual. Also, make sure to avoid the lunch rush if you can. I got here at 11.30 on a weekday and barely had to wait.

It was so good that we had to go back and eat again.Make sure you try their matcha pudding too! It has the perfect consistency and amount of matcha in it. Perfect way to finish off your meal!The concept of Ichiran is that you pick and pay through a vending machine once you enter. Once you've got your tickets for your chosen items, the employees will seat you and give you a piece of paper for you to choose how you want your noodles cooked, how spicy you'd like it, whether you want green onions or not, all the good stuff. And then, you wait at your table. For the amazing dish to come out. OH, and there is self-serve water stations for customers to grab. The service is pretty good too. There are baskets under the table for you to put your belongings. And they provide wet wipes for you to wipe your hands with. You do not need to tip. Once you're done, you just get up and leave.

I was prepared to wait in line to get to try Ichiran's famous ramen. Lucky enough, there was no line when we arrived just shortly after 9am. Ramen for breakfast? absolutely. At the bottom of the stairs, you'll see a ticketing machine just by the entrance. This is your meal ticket vending machine. We were quickly seated right after, service was efficient and swift. The highlight of the ramen dish was 100% the broth. IT was so rich, \xa0flavourful and perfectly seasoned. The noodles were a close second to the broth. It was perfectly cooked in every way. The noodles not only had a nice al dente bounce to it, but it also held on to the broth so perfectly. The char sui is also a must order with your ramen, it effortlessly falls apart once you take a bite into it. It pairs so well together and will leave you satisfied. I ordered an egg on the side to go with my noodles and pork. I've always been amazed by perfectly cooked the egg yolk is when it comes to Ramen. It was nice and boiled on the outside, but still maintained its rich and creamy yolk on the inside. I mixed everything together once I took my first mouthful. I wish I got to eat this one more time before heading back to Canada. This place has easily ruined Ramen noodles for me moving forward. IT's so good that the reality of not being able to eat this again makes me sad."", ""Similar to other restaurants, you put your money in the machine, you make your choice, take your ticket, etc. except, this place is BUSY. We ended up waiting around 20 minutes before we made it to the machine and then another 10 till we were seated. This place is obviously popular since the line snaked all the way to the stairs and into the street. I thought we were getting a steal, 890 for a bowl of ramen (smidge under 9 bucks) but when we were walking around later, I saw that bowls ranged from 500-800 (5-8 dollars). Either way, it was a good experience. Seating is tight and cramped but they had little baskets for you to pour your stuff in as you ate, it was a nice touch. Before the server takes your order, they give you a sheet to customize your ramen (garlic, richness level, spice, noodle texture, etc.) definitely a cool option since so many folks like things differently. Ramen itself was good, the broth was rich and the pork melted in my mouth. Noodles were fine, wish it had come with an egg instead of having to buy it haha but ces't la vie, it was still good (and I was full)."", ""I don't care if Ichiran is a chain-- my meal here was soooooooooooo good!!!!This location is near the sensoji temple which makes it attract a TON of tourists and foreigners, so they've become very tourist friendly with a lot of English speaking staff.

Payment is required before eating and is done through a vending machine. This restaurant is very tourist friendly and has English everywhere. For vending machine, place money in first then click on what you want. Tickets will come out and once finished, press button for remaining change. You'll then queue up again and given a form, this is to personalise your ramen. I loved this aspect the most as I don't like certain things inside mine. They offer table seats as well as counter, if your not fussed about sitting on a table, it is much quicker to sit at the counter. They'll collect in your forms as well as your tickets once seated and then your food will arrive swiftly. Once your finished you can just leave as you've paid for everything :)"", ""This was my first ramen experience in Japan, and I was pleased! The place is a little hard to find, as we thought we needed to use the elevators to go downstairs to the restaurant. You actually have to go down the set of stairs to go inside. Make sure to go a little earlier than lunchtime to beat the rush! Ichiran is a very interesting experience since you can customize the seasoning stock, richness, amount of garlic, slickness, noodle firmness, etc. You first place your order using a vending machine, fill in the sheet to customize your ramen, then wait for an open seat/table. Ichiran only offers the Tonkotsu ramen, so if you're looking for special ramen broth flavors, this may not be the place for you. I like Tonkotsu ramen, but it would be nice if the menu had a larger variety. Also, my toppings (seaweed, chasu, and egg) were placed on the side, which is nice so that it doesn't get soggy. However, I had to peel the egg myself, and the shell stuck to the egg whites pretty tightly, so that my egg was a torn up mess. Still tasty, but not aesthetic. Overall, I enjoyed the ramen, but I think it was slightly overhyped for me and also slightly on the expensive side. I've actually had better ramen in \xa0San Diego, and I also went to a smaller, less known ramen shop in Japan that I enjoyed better. I would still recommend the Ichiran experience, but if you're visiting Japan, definitely try out the smaller, local shops!"", ""One of my favorite ramen places in Japan, Ichiran is definitely worth the hype. I would highly recommend coming here during off hours especially if you are going to a store near highly touristy areas. I usually go early in the morning when they open. The Asakusa store opens at 8:30am so I usually never have to wait in line if I arrive by 10am.You order via vending machine and there's a recommended set menu that comes with the bowl of ramen, slices of pork, hard boiled egg, wood ear, and seaweed. There's also an order sheet to fill out stating your ramen preferences that range from how strong you would like the broth to be to how much green onions you want which is a novelty to Ichiran. I have yet to find another ramen restaurant that you can customize your ramen bowl based on preferences, but I would recommend going with their suggestion (dotted lines).The texture of the noodle is perfect and the broth perfectly compliments the noodle and sides. I also order a dish of pork topped with spring onions because they are fantastic.""]"

128,Sukiyabashi Jiro Roppongi Hills,4.5,92,"['I thought I knew sushi. I thought I knew what good sushi rice was. I\'ve been to a few renowned Japanese places and spoken w many self-proclaimed sushi experts who have all told me, ""Jiro is good but a bit overpriced for what it is and there are better...""I am so glad I went ahead and tried Jiro for myself before passing judgment because MY TASTEBUDS now know what EPIC SUSHI RICE is supposed to taste like and now sushi is ruined for me forever. Takashi-San was very hospitable and thoroughly explained every bite. He also affectionately joked how his established is more laid back than the original Ginza location, where they are 100% focused on food and do not say much as they present each delicious piece of sushi. But back to that sushi rice. It\'s warm, about body temperature, with the perfect amount of vinegar... able to hold its shape when you pick it up yet melts in your mouth immediately. Seriously folks. This was a game changer. Definitely a bucket list foodie established that cannot be missed.', ""This review is way overdue. It's been over five years since I've had Jiro's sushi and I still cannot forget about it to this day. The best sushi I've ever had in my life, and I like to think I've had a lot of sushi in my life. From the not so delicious but stuff your face conveyor belt sushi and ayce sushi to omakase in Tokyo, even at Tsukiji Market, back when they still use to do the fish market. But back to Jiro, and how the second son of the great Jiro in Ginza, did something spectacular. I had my cousin make a reservation for me before I came back to tokyo, and luckily he was able to make a lunch rezzy. The only difference between lunch and dinner is about $100 and a few pieces of nigiri. After the omakase, you can order some more pieces of nigiri, from what was had earlier or what was not served and what he offers. Now back to the sushi. This was the most sublime and enlightening experience I've had when it comes to food, not only sushi. The way Jiro explains each piece of nigiri, and how it was prepared to how to eat it, made a world of difference. The one thing he told me that has stuck with me to this day is how to judge the quality of tuna. He said that everyone likes to go for the fatty cuts like toro or o-toro. But he said that the fat content in those pieces hides the true quality of the fish. The best way to really judge the quality of tuna is by tasting the akami, lean part of the tuna. And he was correct. You can really taste a difference in quality when tasting the leaner cut.Each piece was fantastic, but would stood out to me was the smoked bonito, the ikura, and the uni. The ikura was fantastic because it was freshwater salmon vs salt water. And because of that, it was not as salty but burst with flavor as you bit into each piece of roe. And the uni.. oh the uni. Absolutely exceptional and the best thing I believe I've ever tasted. Everytime I think of it it brings a smile to my face. If you have the opportunity, you definitely have to try sukiyabashi jiro, whether it's the one here in roppongi, or the OG in Ginza"", 'We were lucky enough to have our dinner reserved here during our honeymoon. Everything was perfect - excellent food and excellent chef! Ingredient was so fresh! I haven\'t had any sushi for more than 2 months after I returned to the U.S. Apparently, after having so much tasty sushi, my body rejects anything inferior lol Chef was very talkative. He speaks many different languages including English, Japanese, and Chinese. He can also speak some dialects, which is very impressive. He also shared his learning experiences (mostly language related) and educated us about different ingredient. For example, he told us how to distinguish the gender of sea urchins based on color and/or taste. If you don\'t speak Japanese, this place is probably the better option.Toward the end of the meal, we witnessed how tough it is to be an apprentice of a top-notch chef. We can hear the chef ""yelling"" at his apprentices about washing things too slow, not preparing enough ingredients, serving the customer too slow, etc. It was really tough... I\'ve always heard how hard it is to become a sushi chef in Japan, so good luck to you all.', ""Chef Takashi is the second son of Chef Jiro Ono. Takashi was trained by his father at the original Sukiyabashi Jiro in Ginza before setting up his own restaurant, Sukiyabashi Jiro Roppongi. Chef Takashi also appears in the Jiro Dreams Of Sushi documentary talking about his relationship with his father and continuing Jiro's legacy.Chef Takashi might not be everyone's cup of tea. He is in general pleasant towards customers, especially if you take care to observe a few rules (e.g. not wearing strong perfume, not dipping the sushi in more soy sauce...). His English is also remarkably fluent, and he even speaks some Mandarin Chinese and Taiwanese. However, he can be rather blunt and outspoken on certain political issues (only applicable if you speak Japanese), and can definitely rub some people the wrong way. Meals move at a brisk pace. A meal of 14-16 pieces of sushi, plus time for extras, clocked in at just under an hour. (Plenty of banter with the chef, as my wife is fluent in Japanese .) This can feel too rushed for some diners, especially if you just want to take your time. I did manage to take photographs each time before eating, but it is also a good idea not to leave the sushi on the plate too long - ideally, each piece should be eaten as soon as it lands in front of you. Also is customary to ask him before taking pictures as it's his art on the plate.Once you finish your meal, there is no time to linger or order more saki. As Takashi will say, we are a fine dining experience not a bar to hang out unless you are still eating. The freight on this dining experience averages about $350 per person with saki so don't pass out when you look at your Amex statements after Tokyo in general.This is next level sushi here folks and he is a true master. The bar has definitely been raised for this Cali boy!"", 'This restaurant gets a five star BUT with a very big caveat that you may see others and yourself be treated in a way that would not reflect what is typically expected at a three star place. First the food... the sushi was amazing here but very edo style. What I mean is the sushi was more dependent on quality than on seasoning. The good thing was that the sushi was expertly prepared... but the sushi was prepared without any marinade, torching, or smoking (except for the bonito) unlike what you normally see in American omakase places. So, people who are used to that American style may find this sushi more plain. However, without the embellishments, I could tell that the fish was very fresh and prepared with amazing technique. There was nothing offensive and the uni was some of the best I ever had (also the blood clam and the toro!) I loved every piece.Furthermore, you got a lot of food with just the sushi course. I was willing to shell out extra money for the optional pieces at the end of the meal but I was TOTALLY stuffed. I think it came out to like 19 pieces! Did not need to add the sashimi course. I really appreciate how generous this place was with portion compare to places in the US!The chef was SO knowledgeable about all of the fish and techniques. He apparently only started learning English a few years ago but is able to explain all of these great facts to us. He told us all about the different fishes and preparation styles. My boyfriend said that this was an education. It really made the experience even more special. He was sociable and charismatic! However, the ""uglier"" side of this business that people report is also true. There was a couple whose English was not their first language (maybe from Thailand) and they got the sashimi course. Even though the chef told them they were the only ones that got the sashimi course, they were still confused as to why they were getting different pieces. The chef seemed very annoyed with the couple. Later, the couple would leave food on their plates and the chef would tell them to eat it. When they were getting full and the chef told them they should have warn him earlier. He then complained to the staff about them in Japanese. The chef also got mad at one of his assistants and berated him the entire dinner while the student apologized numerous times. I think these sorts of things may damper one\'s meal but I think it is very standard for this sort of field. I like to think that instead of being customers, we are having the honor of eating art created by a master.', ""Boyfie planned the most epic anniversary dinner in the world! I really don't know how he plans on topping it next year :P Aside from the trouble of finding this place, the experience was epic. I was a little intimated going into the dinner because I've heard the craziest stories of how people are pressured to eating as quickly as possibly or whatnot, but that just wasn't the case here. Although Chef Takashi did not look welcoming at first, he really opened up quickly into our meal and made us feel comfortable. I won't lie, it was one of the quietest meals of my life, but it was worth every second. We had about 20 pieces and I was insanely stuffed at the end. We added a piece of abalone which was hands down the best abalone I've ever had in my life. It was so tender and flavorful unlike other abalone I've tried with a tough, chewy texture. The bonita was the best thing I ever tasted in my life... I can actually still taste a little in my mouth till this day... if you are curious as to how it's made, watch Jiro Dreams of Sushi. I still don't understand how amazing they made sushi taste here, but I can honestly say the hype is real. This is after eating at Sushi Dai at the Tsukiji Market (I thought that was the best sushi I'll ever have in my life at the time). We had a jaw dropping reaction to each piece we were given and my boyfie and I both looked at each other was amazement after each bite.I'm ruined forever and I'll forever dream of the amazing sushi I had here. I think I truly understand the meaning of dreaming of sushi ;)Hands down the BEST SUSHI OF MY LIFE."", 'I agree with Barack Obama on one thing...""This is the best sushi I\'ve ever had in my life"" After watching the Netflix documentary ""Jiro Dreams of Sushi"" I was determined to try this family\'s art of sushi. There were levels of preparations before we sat down in front of Jiro\'s youngest son to enjoy this culinary experience.First, emotionally....My husband teased me for weeks that I would either be thrown out of this Michelin starred restaurant or they would plaster ""No sushi for Basi"" posters with my face all over Japan. \xa0Dare I say Why? Well....because \xa0I\'m a full on Deconstructor! I find most places don\'t make their sushi right....too much rice, not enough rice, too little wasabi in between fish and rice, too small piece, too large piece...the end result is I deconstruct my sushi to make my own individual perfect bite cuz I\'m a sushi snob. OK? Fine, I said it. So I was a bit terrified to eat here. I didn\'t want to offend and I was afraid I wouldn\'t be able to finish the entire served meal. I even practiced no deconstruction prior to arriving here and it was plain inedible torture for me and pure entertainment for my husband.Well my fear was laid to rest. Master Takashi Ono is a bigger sushi snob than myself and therefore his care and love that goes into each piece is pure perfection. I didn\'t have to nor did I want to change ANY piece of sushi he placed on my plate. Each piece melted in my mouth in harmony. There were textures and flavors and sensations I have never experienced before. All extremely distinctive and delicious. The rice was perfect, the fish was fresh, the temperature was exact, he glossed each piece with a paintbrush dipped in soy. Or he changed the sauce and told you not to dip it in soy. He described each fish like a sommelier discussing wine. It was like being gently led into a whole new world of sushi craftsmanship.Second, some preparation on etiquette was deemed necessary.....Although Jiro\'s son seems to be more relaxed than his father he is still his disciplined apprentice and now his son also works here as an apprentice, so one should respect that. Photos are allowed but seem disrespectful during dinner. Your sushi is meant to be eaten the minute it touches your plate, so even waiting a few minutes to take a photo diminished that flow. The lady next to us kept snapping photos and the stern look on the chef\'s face still makes us giggle and glad that it wasn\'t aimed at us. Using your hands or chop sticks is both perfectly acceptable. Dress is business casual. Lastly, the reservations...This is the hardest part. The reservations have to be made by someone in Japan; your hotel concierge or a local. Chef Takashi explained this to us that in the past there were too many cancellations by foreigners. They also have to be made exactly a month in advance, on the first of the month, when reservations are taken for the following month. Unfortunately, even with our hotel concierge working a month in advance and spending 3 hours attempting to reserve a seat at Jiro\'s restaurant in Ginza, we were unable to reserve a seat. However, we are so grateful to have experienced his son\'s restaurant in Roppongi Hills.The experience:-The restaurant is hidden away in a business district. There are areas to sit & wander about so we arrived early because there was no way I was going to be late and start off as an annoying American. Familiarize yourself with the external view as there are no English signs. The restaurant has only seven (7) sushi bar seats and two of those are always reserved for his regular customers. If they do not come for a meal, he does not fill them on purpose. There are two tables used only for waiting. We were seated here for about 2 minutes before we were moved to the sushi bar. \xa0 -The sushi itself is indescribable.-Chef Takashi Ono was stern but friendly, talked openly with all of us and answered questions easily. It was interesting to hear him discuss why women cannot be sushi chefs (mainly due to hormonal fluctuations that affect the sense of smell). It was fun hearing him recite greetings in Polish or any of the other 40 languages he knows. I was amazed when he stated his son at the age of 18 stopped being his son and become the apprentice. It was fun seeing his son shy away from the camera and smile and it was evident how hard he works to please his father. A family tradition that demonstrates the dedication of hard work and love of sushi is apparent. \xa0At the end of the meal, he will take as many photos with you as you like and he loves the thumbs up;)-A truly memorable experience of artistic culinary expression within a disciplined, traditional family setting. Sadly, to me no other place (except maybe his dad\'s or someday his son\'s) will compare. \xa0Eat here with caution as it may ruin your sushi dining experiences forever. \xa0BarbaraD dreams of being a regular (even with the ~$300 per person per meal price tag) ;)', 'Yes, we watched the documentary; yes, we were a bit nervous and excited at the same time; and absolutely yes, this was an unbelievable and unforgettable experience! A couple of things; this is not your typical ""let\'s hang out and have sushi and have some drinks"" type of meal. This is a ""let\'s have amazing sushi and learn about the food that we\'re eating."" \xa0Also, it\'s clear that the chef is extremely proud of what he does and they have this whole experience down to a science, so I could see how some may be turned off. \xa0With that being said, the entire staff was respectful, accommodating and dare I say, the chef was quite amusing and entertaining. \xa0We were fortunate to have another ""sushi experience"" the following evening and all I could think about was this meal. Lastly, yes, it is expensive however, we have spent equally with mediocre sushi in comparison, factoring in gratuity, so for me, it was completely worth it! \xa0Book it now!!', ""Overall a really wonderful experience. I loved how chef Jiro was super friendly, speaks a little bit of 40 different languages and tries to interact with all the guests. He even made sure to come out and take a picture with you and send you off after the meal. If you're expecting mind-blowing sushi because of the movie Jiro Dreams of Sushi, then set your expectations lower. Everything was great but only a few pieces were amazing and possibly couldn't be beat by other sushi restaurants -- ikura (marinated overnight in-house so it doesn't have the salty ocean taste), uni (the sweetest uni I've EVER had, they must have first dibs of the top uni!), smoked bonito (never had this at other sushi restaurants before), anago (usually I don't like eel, but Jiro's definitely made me feel differently about it) and of course their famous tamago.TIP: If you don't want to overspend but still get a full Jiro experience, get reservations for lunch! We spent ~$160/person for lunch and left super full!"", ""I was so full that my belt was about to cut off circulation between two halves of my body whilst my growing triple chin was about to drag me off the bar stool. And when the chef asked me if I wanted more sushi I said yes because he is the glorious son of Jiro Ono.Standouts:- Uni, sweetest and creamiest uni that did not taste like coagulated piss- Ikura, house-prepared salmon roe that did not taste like salt bombs from most other places- Bonito, perfectly smoked on the outside like in Jiro Dreams of Sushi- Abalone, tear-jerkingly the best abalone I've tasted- Mantis shrimp, comes with roe, umami AFI left the restaurant a happy seafood octomom""]"

132,bills Ginza,4,32,"[""My wife and I had the opportunity to visit Japan for two weeks back in January 2020. It's hard to find a lot of international breakfast places in Japan but when we discovered Bills in Ginza, we couldn't have been happier!We literally went to Bills every morning for breakfast and three times for dinner. Their breakfast was most likely one of the best breakfasts I've ever had. The eggs Benedict was to die for! We've tried to recreate them at home but it didn't work out lol. But our ultimate favorite is their ricotta pancakes...OMG!!! We literally had the pancakes everyday after each meal and we still couldn't get enough. We loved them so much that we risked missing our flight to get two orders before we leave. All in all, Bills in Ginza was an amazing experience with a beautiful view of Tokyo. We can't wait to go back!!"", '4.5 / 5.0 - Bills is one of my all-time favorite brunch spots.I love their Ricotta Pancakes (2,200 yen), which comes with fresh bananas and honeycomb butter. It\'s not overly sweet and they give you syrup on the side, so you can adjust the level of sweetness, which I liked.The Wagyu (Japanese beef) Cheeseburger (2,600 yen) was good, but not my favorite. The patty was ok and the cheese didn\'t cover the entire burger. I preferred ketchup (which I asked them for) over the green chili and herb mayo sauce it came with, although my friend liked it. And the ""pickles"" just tasted like cucumbers without much flavor. The fries on the side were nice and crispy, though.Most of the other bills I\'ve been to have been by the water, which you don\'t have with this one. This location right in the middle of Ginza, though, with spacious and comfortable seating.Can\'t wait to have the pancakes again :)', ""Having been impressed by very popular air pancake hot spot A Happy Pancake up in Shinjuku, I felt the need to give the competition a try. While bills dished up some good air pancakes, they fell short of what I'd had at Happy Pancake. Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?The location of this bills in Ginza is impressive, with a 12th floor floor to ceiling window setup that has views of the main street below and the Bvlgari hotel. The service is what you might expect being both classy and attentive. Star. Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?$21.00 for pancakes is... very expensive, especially when you consider that a very similar offering from A Happy Pancake is almost exactly half that price. Even so, bills is clearly a more upscale establishment and given this location I wasn't surprised. Star. Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?bills iteration of air pancakes is fixed with a combination of ricotta and bananas. It's a good combination and the pancakes themselves are good, but they were a bit more doughy than what I'd experienced at Happy Pancake, and there wasn't nearly enough syrup in the mix to carry these over the line. Single Star. Star 5: Would you be excited to go back?Given the price point and the competition, I wouldn't be. No Star."", ""I came here for pancakes and drinks only so I feel like I can only give 4 stars although I would say I had a near 5-star experience.Upon entering the 12th floor, you can immediately sense the posh, modern and aesthetic vibe they have created. Looking around at the aesthetics and decor, I almost felt like I was back in LA. I immediately noticed the wrap-around windows that allow for optimal natural lighting. With the super cute, modern art-deco-ish booths and adorable library room on the side, there really is no bad seat here.We ordered the ricotta pancakes with banana and honeycomb butter, because we already had a previous savory breakfast before coming here (LOL). The pancakes are a fluffy but don't expect souffle pancake fluffiness. Not sure if it's fair to compare the two, as souffle pancakes are purposely made to be overly fluffy and airy, so just keep that in mind regarding your expectations. The honeycomb butter and fresh banana pair really well with the plain pancake and drizzle of syrup. I loved my hot yuma matcha latte and the coffee was good but quite small portions for the price. Prices were steep here, pancakes almost $20 USD and drinks $8 each or more. Bill's is definitely filled with foreigners and tourists maybe looking for a somewhat familiar experience, non-Japanese brunch/breakfast or something more Western-ized. You don't really feel like you're in Japan. Don't get me wrong, there were some local families here but their menu and staff definitely cater to a Western crowd. Nothing wrong with it but if you're looking for more cultural experiences, you won't get that vibe here.Overall, would definitely recommend coming here for a breakfast or brunch experience. Would love to try afternoon tea here next time! One of the best things about Bill's, in my opinion, is that they are open EARLY so you can start eating at 8:30am! This is awesome if you're jet-lagged or just awake early and want to eat ASAP. You'll notice many other establishments (besides 24h casual places) are not open that early. Happy eating!"", ""Bills was definitely not what I expected. I'd imagined it to be a casual Aussie surfer cafe and instead it felt like a glam department store restaurant. Almost all of the patrons were women who were either eating Bills' famous thick pancakes or the 3-story tower of tea cakes. My husband had the shrimp burger which he said was heavily spiced and I had the tea smoked salmon salad. It took about 30 minutes to receive our food, at 2 pm in the afternoon no less. Bills was pricy. The burger, salad, a cup of tea and 2 glasses of white wine added up to about USD 77."", ""This bill's is on the 12th floor. There is a nice view of Ginza, but the windows' nice view is broken up by the paneling/slats.We got seated at the bar immediately whereas waiting for a table would have been about 30 minutes.I tried the raw smoothie (1100 yen or so) and the ricotta hotcakes (1800 yen).To be fair, I'm not normally a fan of pancakes. But according to my friend whose favorite hotcakes were at bill's Odaiba location, the pancakes I had didn't taste very special at all as they hardly had any ricotta taste. Most of the ricotta quality I think was in the texture. It felt like I was just eating my way through mush.I actually ended up leaving half a hotcake behind because it just didn't taste that good (and this was after forcing myself to finish one more).The raw smoothie was decent but wow the portion was small for being about 1100 yen."", 'Very posh spot in Ginza to come have a high end breakfast.We started with a bloody marry and some fresh squeezed OJ. The bloody marry was very unique in that you could taste each vegatable in the glass. They must really infuse the mixers here! The OJ was not bad. Not super sweet but I would probably skip this.Next the cold drip coffe contraption caught my eye so I ordered one and it was very smooth and not bitter at all. Plus it gave me that kick I needed to start my sightseeing for the day.To eat we got the small portion of the coconut toast. This tasted like a french toast with attitude. The butter on the side really put it over the top.Next we had the crab fried rice with poached egg. Soooo yummy. I liked the japanese pickle and kimchi cooked in the rice contrasting with the fried whole crab. Squeeze some lime over thistles and some siracha and your in buisness.To finish it all off we split the ricotta hot cakes with honey comb butter and fresh bananas. Wow this dish was 10/10 you must get this if you come here.

I had excellent service, they have a great menu of fresh local fish, sushi, chicken, pasta and other dishes. \xa0I chose a small salad, side of french fries, and a local fish of the day which was grouper or mahi if memory serves with fresh veggies. \xa0All was delicious. I enjoyed the live violin/acoustic music at the bar area by two talented young men who played acoustic versions with no words of current hits. \xa0It was an interesting take with string instruments for current pop and rock songs.

Yes, they have green tea beer and it's great. It has your typical beer taste with green tea as an after taste. Everything here has green tea in it! Even the steak dish I got came with green tea salt to flavor. What a cool experience. The food was not my favorite but because of the presentation and different items it made it special.

Recommend the tasting menu, even if the salad/soup dishes might not appeal to some :) Price is an imho bargain for the quality of the meat (120 CAD w/out booze) and that staff do the grilling for you. The only sort of drawback is that you get so used to seeing Sushi, yakitori, ramen masters preparing food and suddenly here you've college kids grilling your meat, but they'll do it right. The ambience, hence, can be more like heading to any other Korean bbq joint. Note: If you're not ok with eating raw beef or egg, you'll need to think twice before heading here.

The atmosphere of the restaurant was very luxurious. The dessert of shaved ice with fruit was humongous but actually a light dessert and a nice finish to the meal.

At one point he bring out truffles and shaves a very generous amount over a piece of meat he has just cooked in a broth. Seriously, this place is foodie heaven.

They have different types of Oyakodon for lunch, but I suggest you go for the normal one (1,000 JPY) if you don't have any previous experience with Oyakodon. As their Oyakodon is popular for its loose top (very lightly cooked egg on top, compared to average Oyakodon out there) -- Keep that in mind if you are not good with half-done egg dishes.

My friends and I waited for a short amount of time before being seated at three of the eight stools available. The owner had even shuffled one of the patrons down a seat in order to accommodate us. The setting is super small, super intimate, and makes you feel like you are right in the kitchen. They only serve one dish and after you order you can see them make it in front of your eyes. The dish is so simple yet so delicious. Katsu over rice and egg with sauce drizzled on top. I don't really know what else to say but this place is a must try if you like katsu and omurice.

It only sits 8 people so while it causes a long line, it creates an intimate, homey feel with very personal care and attention. With that said, definitely come early and avoid prime meal hours. But even if you don't and you're forced to wait in line, I would recommend to stay anyway - it's definitely worth the wait. There is no menu - everyone is served tea, soup, and chicken katsu and egg over rice. The only thing they'll ask you is what size you want. The only difference in the sizes is the amount of rice, and it's all the same price (1000 yen). The food itself is incredible. The katsu is so tender and juicy with a perfectly crispy skin. It's lightly dressed with a sauce that adds flavor, while not making the katsu soggy at all. The katsu sits on a warm bed of soft and creamy egg that hugs a mound of rice. This way, each bite has a perfect combination of rice, egg, and katsu. Perfect. I would go to Shibuya just for this place."", 'I had this review sitting in my drafts from two years ago, and I had wanted to follow through on it because I\'m so happy I was recommended this spot. While I was studying in Tokyo, my roommate had recommended me this place once I told them that one of my favorite Japanese dishes was katsudon. After class one day, I decided to see if I could find it! Please note that I am writing this as a visitor from America and maybe it will help those that are interested from my background as well!To start, the place is a little difficult to find. It\'s tucked away on the lower open level of a building, and Google Maps will probably misdirect you to it (I remember walking around that area at least two times trying to find it). It\'s a very tiny shop too, seems like a lot of locals come in. I unfortunately know the bare minimum of Japanese, so I didn\'t know what to expect since I wasn\'t able to communicate. This isn\'t wrong to the place by any means, but it\'s just something to be aware if you are a foreigner visiting. I still got my katsudon haha! But they kind of just hand it to you without question, after a bowl of miso! This did make me nervous because I only had about 40 or so yen in my wallet at the time and didn\'t know how much I was going to pay for the whole meal (if they just kept handing me food ). Once I got the katsudon, I was able to ask (butchered) how much everything was, and they responded 10¥ (~$10) I said, ""for the katsudon?"" No, it was for the whole meal.... shocked over how cheap it was!!! Especially for being tucked away in Shibuya! Now for the katsudon, I can see why my roommate suggested it! It was delicious! The pork was crunchy and tasty! I personally don\'t care for runny eggs (I\'m in the minority, I know) so that was my only dislike about it, but it\'s not that it wasn\'t good! And you can\'t beat the price!So I give it 4/5, only for the unclear directions shown on Google! Otherwise, I definitely recommend checking this place out when you visit Shibuya!', ""The best katsudon in Tokyo? \xa0So far, it's found at Katsudonya Zuichou in Shibuya, Tokyo. \xa0The meaning of the restaurant name says it all: \xa0katsudon (breaded pork cutlet and egg over rice with sauce), and zuicho (auspicious sign). \xa0I will rave about this katsudon because it was THAT good and have never tasted anything better than this. \xa0That is my last meal on earth right now!We had just viewed Shibuya Crossing on the second floor of Starbucks, just outside the Shibuya train station. \xa0This is the busiest intersection in Japan and possibly in the world, with up to 3,000 people crossing the street from all directions during peak time.We were behind schedule and needed to get a really late lunch or an early dinner. \xa0Accessing Yelp to find restaurants nearby, we saw a restaurant specializing in katsudon and had a perfect 5-star rating with 24 reviews. \xa0We turned on the Yelp directions, which noted a 10-minute walk and off we went. \xa0The directions took us away from the people-crazed madness of loud noise and neon lights to quieter side streets and a long alleyway used by the locals. \xa0According to our cellphone, we arrived at Katsudonya Zuichon.But where is it? \xa0There was no restaurant that we could see. \xa0There was a door to a reddish-brown brick building with an English sign that stated that no katusdon was served there. \xa0Was that the restaurant and was it closed? \xa0There were two deliverymen that went into that door and came out a few minutes; we asked them about the restaurant, and they said they didn't know. \xa0We stood there, wondering whether Yelp was correct, as we walked around the surrounding area without seeing any restaurant. \xa0We began to think about looking for another restaurant when we walked through a dark hallway in that same building and lo and behold, there was the restaurant, behind the front wall of the building. \xa0Afterwards, we realized that there was a Japanese restaurant sign in the front, but because we're unable to read Japanese....Katsudonya Zuichou was such a small restaurant with only 8 counter seats. \xa0There was another couple that was waiting for seats and fortunately, they spoke English and confirmed that this indeed was the restaurant. \xa0The couple told us that the food is excellent here, and that there are lines that form out to the street during peak hours.Okay, we're in our two counter seats where we can see the friendly and personable mother and daughter cooking and preparing the meals. \xa0No problem that we don't speak Japanese, as there is no varied menu dishes; they serve only one dish here - katsudon with a clear hot broth with a few somen noodles and fish cake, cold jasmine tea (with refills), tsukemono, and beer if you want. \xa0We just had to choose whether we wanted regular size or large size, both at the same price of 1000 yen, the difference being the amount of rice.The katsudon is made to order, so you can watch your dish being freshly prepared. \xa0The preparation of this dish, I think, is the secret to its excellence. \xa0The steaming, sweet and fluffy rice was topped with a thin semi-cooked egg that resembled a crepe, with a delicious sweet and savory sauce. \xa0We saw the pork cutlet being pounded to tenderize it prior to breading it with panko, then frying it and dipped into a special sauce before placing it onto the egg-rice combination. \xa0Aha, that's the secret to ensure a crispy katsu instead of cooking all together, which would result in a soggy katsu (which is how it's done in HNL). \xa0The flavors were astounding! \xa0The perfect combination of the crispy pork, fluffy egg and rice, and the tasty sweet and savory sauce was simply orgasmic! \xa0Yes, the best katsudon that we've had! \xa0You could tell it was good, as all 8 people were gulping down their katsudon without saying a word! \xa0Oishii!Frequented by locals, this popular small family restaurant is open from 11:30 am to 8:00 pm Mon. to Sat., closed Sun. and holidays. \xa0Shibuya Station, exit 3. \xa0Literally, a hole-in-the-wall restaurant, and I give credit to the Japanese in using every available space that they have for amazing businesses like this. \xa0Katsudonya Zuichou is now a must-go restaurant for our future trips to Tokyo. \xa0Thank you, Yelp, for sending us there!"", ""I am so happy that I decided to satisfy my cravings for Katsu-don here! \xa0If you've never had Katsu-don no need to fear. \xa0It is a very simple dish: with a breaded pork or sometimes chicken cutlet deep fried then topped with a beaten egg that cooks in seconds in the hot oil and becomes the gooey rich delicious goodness that holds the whole thing together! \xa0Served atop a bed of rice (you can choose between a small, medium, or large portion of rice with no variation on price). \xa0Finally a sweet and savory brown sauce is drizzled over the Katsu-don completing this bowl of perfection.I arrived at 11:30 right as they opened and it was already full with a small line of 6 people ahead of me. \xa0Good thing I arrived when I did cause it got even longer. \xa0The restaurant has only 8 seats so you'll have to be patient, but once you are seated the food arrives within minutes! \xa0Love this place and would definitely come back!"", 'Hella tiny spot, but big on flavor.

Ordered a katsudon; they serve either a large or regular size, both for ¥1000 ($10). The chef will give you a bowl of miso soup and some barley tea. If you need refills, just ask for more tea. After eating the amazing katsudon, place whatever dishes you're done with on the ledge the chef serves you on. Pay and leave. The chef speaks enough english for you to get exactly what you want. I highly recommend this place.

Our waitress, Hutu, was excellent and the restaurants atmosphere was a modern take on classic Japan, warm and inviting. They even hit us with free hand warmers on our way out. Hospitality was big here and appreciated. As for the food, the A5 wagyu skewer was our main event, and we ended up ordering two of them. I'm going to have dreams about that thing for a long time. The rest of our meats were all delicious as well. We tasted some of the grilled cheese skewer options and they were super tasty and recommended. Also had the fried eggplant with sausage miso sauce and it was unlike anything I've ever had. Highly recommended if you're in Tokyo and looking for some amazing grilled meats."", ""My favorite yakitori was in Osaka but unfortunately I was not there for this Japan trip and had to find something in Tokyo and luckily I came across this one which was awesomely not too far away from my hotel.The staff were very friendly and welcoming. Like many places, it was pretty small and tight in spacing. They have an English menu and they accept credit cards which is one of the key things I appreciate when dining in Japan as I don't like holding much cash.We focused primarily on chicken skewers as that's essentially what yaki tori means. We basically ordered everything they offered in terms of chicken and some other pieces such as lamb and a pork skewer. Everything was cooked very well, nice and juicy. My typical favorite chicken skewer is the chicken balls (tsukune) but sadly this place was just mediorce for me. It was lacking tenderness I was expecting and the flavor wasn't as pure chicken as I would have liked. Also there was no raw egg yolk to dip the skewer which I was accustomed to. Rest of the pieces though were on point, the tail, kidneys, liver, heart, tail, veins, etc.We also tried the soft tofu which was nice and refreshing. We ended up ordering almost 13-15 skewers a person and we were stuffed! Great place and would definitely come here again if in the area!"", ""Best yakiroti I've had in my life!The potato croquette with tartar sauce is phenomenal. \xa0Cut into it and the yolk of a perfectly cooked soft boiled egg oozes down the croquette and adds even more creamy goodness to the dish. \xa0 I seriously could have just eaten these all night and been a perfectly happy camper. \xa0You MUST get this!We also got a bunch of yakitori including the AAAAA beef. \xa0We weren't brave enough to try the horsemeat sashimi. \xa0 \xa0 \xa0We stopped in during the afternoon and were able to make a reservation for dinner the following evening \xa0They do have a per person seating \xa0charge, but who cares? \xa0Worth every yen.Kick your shoes off (mandatory), and get ready for some really mind blowing yakitori."", 'Best all around yakitori I have ever had. We came for a late night snack on a Sunday around 11 pm. Walking by the place almost looked closed but we asked and they said ""we\'re open until 5 am today!"" We got a bunch of yakitori, including chicken heart, gizzards, meatball with sauce, pork belly, beef short ribs, and beef tongue. Everything was tender, flavorful, and just mouthwateringly amazing! The service was great, very friendly and accommodating to English speakers.', ""I really loved this yakitori place in the Roppongi area of Tokyo. Highly recommend by both a friend and our hotel. We luckily scored a last minute reservation for a shared table. The yakitori was fantastic. Highlights were the skirt steak, beef tongue, pork wrapped asparagus, seared scallops, and chicken legs skewers. I ate so much I eventually stopped taking pictures.. too busy gorging on the deliciousness. The amberjack sashimi was phenomenal.. I had never tried before. The avocado with seaweed was so refreshing. We had lots of sake and enjoyed making new friends with our table mates. This place is very traditional. Shoes off at the front and very cozy inside. It gets a bit Smokey from the grill but such a pleasant atmosphere you don't want to go home. Our bill was approx $110 for 2 adults and 2 kids which was super reasonable.. especially with the amount we ate. For sure recommend if your in the area."", ""After attending the Belgian Beer Festival in Roppongi Hills, my bf and I were super hungry and we walked to Jomon for some yakitori. Luckily, we arrived early and were seated because it seemed like reservation was highly encouraged at this small joint. We had the supreme loin, beef tongue, beef skirt, boneless short rib, beef neck, chicken breast, chicken liver, lettuce and cheese bacon roll, scallops, beef stew, and beef sashimi. Omg, the food was just so delicious all around. The very simple cabbage appetizer tasted great even though it was plain. We asked for refills. As for the skewers, everything tasted well-seasoned and of high quality. All the meats were so juicy and tender that we had to order a second round for each. Even the iced barley tea tasted refreshing on a warm night.The most memorable for me had to be the lettuce and cheese bacon roll because the melted cheese united all the ingredients together perfectly. To my surprise, the cheese was not overwhelmingly cheesy and did not have a strong flavor profile. It simply provided the gooey texture that enveloped the lettuce and bacon.Overall, I highly recommend Jomon Roppongi. Most of the staff were comfortable speaking English and food came out of the kitchen quickly. This was my bf's favorite restaurant throughout the entire Japan trip!"", ""This place provided me one of my best Yakitori experiences ever. My flight arrived late in Tokyo and dropped my luggage off at my hotel which was right around the corner. I was hungry so I went strolling for a great place to get some good food and drinks. While randomly walking past this gem, the host instantly took us in and ordered a Suntory beer in draft while looking at the menu. The Amberjack Sashimi was amazing! I could've ordered it all night. I also ordered some yakitori such as Short Rib, Japanese Pepper, Asparagus Bacon, and Pear Bacon. Everything was so delicious!!! I also ordered the Spicy Noodle which was decent.The food was so good that I even went back for a 2nd visit on day 4 of my trip to Tokyo. I will also be be back on my next visit to Tokyo."", 'Great spot! Lively, friendly, and with good food and drinks to match. Recommended for a date.', ""Horrible customer service and too smoky. First they didn't tell that they charged for seats and tea that most restaurants in Japan don't charge. Most customers here are foreign travelers. That's why... Also some waitresses could not tell me what today's special, what kind of sake, and etc without going back to the kitchen again and again.Taste: Asparagus wrapped with pork and grilled avocado were tasty. Lamb tasted marinated by msg.Price: Overpriced. Not tasty tea ¥300 $3. A seat ¥300 $3.Customer service: Horrible.Tip: They serve a free tiny cup of tea at the end. But if you don't ask, they don't serve. Aw....I will never come back here again. The staff should have explained their fees better."", ""This. Was. So. Good. Came by after reading up on reviews and suggestions online for great places to eat in Roppongi, Tokyo. The food was so fresh and so good. We sat right in front of the chef as he did his thing. Everything had plenty of flavor and was cooked to perfection. I had the chicken gizzard, lamb shoulder and chicken leg. My friend had the chefs special which consisted of 8 assorted sticks including beef, chicken, veggies and pork and also added on a scallion stick. We also got a hot sake which was great. They give a complimentary cabbage that comes with the table fee. I hope to be able to come back during my time in Tokyo and enjoy the scenery and food again. As far as seating goes I would definitely recommend reservations as they are booked out constantly. You can call or contact on what's app, etc. just verify on website. They have bar seating, 'outdoor seating' and dining room seating. In true Japanese fashion shoes are not allowed inside so wear shoes easy to get in and out of it you can help it. They do not split checks here so also be prepared for that with your cash on hand or with your card (they accept visa and MasterCard). Try whatever your heart desires as I truly don't believe you can go wrong here.""]"

Butcher shop and steakhouse?! Count us in!When you first enter there is no hint of a resto, looks like a nice butcher shop on the outside. Butcher at the entrance asks whether you've a reso and then calls a waiter who then ushers you to the back where there is a resto with minimal & casual decor -but nice looking. You're then given a menu (has some explanation in English).

I did feel that their aged beef is very high quality and was definitely one of the best aged beef dishes I ever had, but it was pretty pricy as well. If you intend to eat and drink a lot, you should be ready to pay 20,000-30,000 JPY per person (the average spending is probably between10,000-15,000).']"

This was our favorite meal of the trip! Oh my gosh... juicy pieces of beef, crisp on the outside, served rare so you can cook to your preference. It just melts in your mouth! We loved it so much that we decided we HAD to eat it at least once a day... not very healthy but hey, we're on vacation. I ordered the No 1 which was the perfect serving size. My husband got the No 3 (double portion). The condiments were also very flavorful and complemented the meat so well. The service was great! Everyone was so nice and the waitress was kind enough to explain the process. If I ever go back to Japan, I would come back here for sure!"", ""Best meal I had in Tokyo hands down. If you're looking for tasty gyukatsu, this is it. The restaurant itself is located on the corner of the street at a tiny basement. The chef and staff prepares everythingin front of you if you got bar seats. I've never tasted a softer melt-in-your-mouth piece of meat, they serve you a cabbage slaw salad majige on the side for a perfect balance. What makes this place so special is the stone grill that they provide to every customer, allowing them to cook their beef to their desires, since some of us like our food more cooked than others. Overall, worth the wait, but I would try to come during lunch time when they're not as busy? Or else you might need to wait for a while."", ""This place is a must. It's a small shop that has a ground floor entrance but has small stairs that goes down into the basement. They really know how to serve a great meal. With the choices being Katsu set or Katsu set with yam in 3 different sizes, it is required for each person to get a dish. A single was more than enough for me.It comes with rare katsu, rice (which you can get one free refill on), miso soup, salad, roe, and the optional yam. The yam is sticky and grated and can be put into the rice with the salty/bitter roe. Each person has a little grill where you can cook the sliced katsu to your liking and there are different sauces for you to try (salt, soy sauce, wasabi sauce). You can pay with card online through a QR card which they will confirm or in cash. This place was amazing and is definitely a great place to take friends as well."", ""Yes, yes, yes. This was easily one of my favorite meals in Japan. My husband and I were visiting Akihabara for some tech-shopping, where naturally we became hungry for lunch. If you're familiar with Donkatsu (usually a pork cutlet), it is a very similar experience but instead the breading is a bit lighter with undercooked beef inside. The entire point is to take the piece and cook it on your own personal stone grill. The lady who helped me recommended 5 seconds on each side, but I'm a medium well, girl... so I did 7, haha. Overall, this was a GREAT lunch. We purchased their regular size (which was enough for me), but my husband made a second order and they were kind enough to just upgrade his order to a large to save a couple Yen. Things to note:1.) This is a small shop and not in the main Akiba area. You have to take a couple of side streets, but its approximately a 7-10 minute walk from Akiba Station. 2.) This is not friendly for disabled persons. There are very steep stairs that you must take in order to enter the building. There are no elevators. 3.) Very minimal table seating. If I want to guess, maybe... 8 tables and 8 seats at the bar? I'm pulling from my memory.4.) Again, it's a small shop.

If you don't have to have dinner I suggest you do an early lunch or possibly an early dinner. If you decide to wait past 530, you'll be waiting for at least an hour. As far as the food, it was outstanding. The beef cutlet was so well prepared it was almost fake. There's no way you would think that the beef was a real piece of meat because the breading was so eloquently prepared it looked as if it should be sitting in a window on display.

It's so hard to eat other katsu now having eaten this delicious juicy rare katsu. The meal set cones with a bowl of fluffy warm rice, miso soup, marbled katsu and grated yam (optional) that you can mix with the rice. There'll be a heated single person grill in front of you if you choose to heat the katsu slices. Watching the fat dripping from the meat and fizzled into the grill was very entertaining on its own. The newly heated meat filled the air with tantalizing smell. Then you chew it and have a mouthgasm while it melted in your mouth.

Also, since it's Japan, no tipping!Torikizoku is very tourist-friendly because you can order everything via a touch screen in English or Japanese.

This place is amazing... This place could be described as the start of my love for steaks. This place is so good I hate it, I hate it because it literally ruined every other steak I will ever eat, including a USDA Prime porterhouse steak from one of the best steak houses in Seattle. While this place is expensive, the course is worth it. The wagyu beef is literally so tender that it feels like cutting through butter with your teach and the way they cook it is not some butter filled, thyme infused garlic sauce rather you are given the cooked meat (choice of how it's cooked but anything under medium rare would be criminal) seared with a bunch of dipping condiments i.e salt and some sauces, in which you can flavor the meat with or not at all. I ordered the Kobe set meal which costs about USD $200,without tax and service charge, and the menu was amazing. The Seared Scorched Wagyu was really just warmed up and it was super fatty making it easily the softest meat I have ever bit into. What followed was foie gras but since this was (unfortunately) the first time I have ever tasted foie gras I had no judgement as to whether it was good or not, but needless to say I loved it. Following the course was some mixed vegetables, which I will not dwell into cause i'm more of a meat junkie. After that came the creme of the crop, the 160g Kobe sirloin, this cut of meat is a Japanese specialty and it saddens to see that there is no strict regulation of the word kobe in America and Australia since the meat is absolutely different. The beef is cooked perfectly and the nothing gets left out, even the fat (which gets cooked down to 10% of its size when it was raw), the steak was gorgeous and nothing could ruin its taste, whether I smothered it in rock salt, some sauce or just ate it plane like that and honestly I could ramble on forever but its hard to describe it. After that came the rice which was honestly not as good as the ones you see in American Hibachi, but that didn't matter to me as I focused less on the rice. After that you got some miso soup and Japanese pickles. Finally came the Shizuoka crown musk melon, this was the 3rd crown to the course, the fruit itself is ridiculously expensive (I think USD $350 for the whole melon) and the taste is phenomenal. The fibers in the fruit look so juicy its as if they injected the melon with fruit. Each bit of that melon is filled with juices and I could literally lightly with my tongue push on a slice of that fruit to a pulp. Not to mention the service is great. You have a personal waiter with the politeness of that is well known in Japan and a chef who is very nice.Overall if you are in Tokyo and have about USD $300 to kill I would highly recommend going there as a priority."", 'Excellent views at lunch time from this 37F location with most seats facing out the window. \xa0Excellent food at reasonable price during lunch hour.

For that reason, I\'m a huge admirer of the fictional character Goro Inogashira from the acclaimed series ""Kodoku no Gourmet"" for his ability to be able to willy-nilly find amazing culinary gems just based on instinct alone.In a world where so much information is available any time at the stroke of your finger tips, it\'s becoming harder and harder to resist the urge to know and understand more than meets the eye; but then it so happens that we\'re only human and sometimes even what seemed like the best of plans sound terribly mortifying the day after -- which is exactly what happened on this business trip.Whereas I had made grand plans to stand in line at yet another renowned ramen joint and spend my last early afternoon in Tokyo under the scorching 30 degrees Celsius sun, having consumed almost no protein over the past few days and filling my stomach with naught but rich ramen/soba broth, I was just about ready to throw up even at the thought of eating another bowl of ramen.But alas sometimes life does throw you a random gem and leave you unexpectedly and completely satisfied out of absolutely nowhere. I haphazardly entered this place on my way to Shimbashi dreading the thought of eating another bowl of ramen, and everywhere else in Tokyo station was bursting with people.To my surprise every item on the establishment\'s menu served the noblest cut of the cow: I opted for the Gyūtandon, which is prepared with steamed wheat, a yuzu-infused yet not so overwhelming shōyu-based tare, and a bed of thin-sliced chewy, soft, fatty, dreamy cow tongue.The ox-tail soup that comes with the set is a godsend, especially after long nights of drinking at Gremlin and waking up still drunk yet not hungover. Geebus and Goro be praised.']"

Work was just next to Tokyo Station, a high rise office building which I still did not know which one. Even though he was hesitant to suggest a tonkatsu place (since our dear mom was complaining we had been eating too much fried food), I told him just planned accordingly and we would order non fried items to appease our mom. We tried to beat the lunch crowd and arrived at the restaurant slightly before 11.30am. As expected, our mom cried foul that we chose another ""fried food place"". I ordered the 2 prawns and 2 pork tenderloin. Food was definitely excellent especially the prawns were definitely a hit. They were so crispy. What so special here was the miso soup that came with the set had some super tiny clams in them. The flavor was slightly different from the usual miso soup and had a seafood flavor in it. Unlike Ginza Bairin, the atmosphere was cold even though the server who took our order was polite. I could not find complete fault in the service, ambience or food. There is just something missing here, maybe a lack of warmth in this place which I had been experiencing everywhere else in Tokyo.

I was intrigued, so we went for lunch on the early side of our trip. And boy am I glad we did.Something we learned during 10 days in Japan is that spice is not their forte. That\'s ok, as Japanese food is amazing as is, yet we both really crave spice in much of our food. Enter Tokyo Tanmen Tonari Misato. We choose this spot amongst the 15-20 restaurants at Ramen Street, based on having a solid line of businessmen, and what appeared to be a spicy ramen picture on the vending machine. Fingers crossed!We successfully ordered ramen, gyoza and Asahi beers via the vending machine, got our tickets, and moved to the line to be seated. Everything moves so efficiently and quickly, we were seated in no time.Once seated, the server asked our spice level preference between 1-4. I selected a 2, my friend, the max of 4. The ramen came and it was covered in red spice and delicious!!!! It packed the heat we wanted, cut perfectly by the dry beer, and the pork gyoza was flavor packed and yummy, too. The server checked on us, concerned the 4 would be too much. Nope! It was just what she wanted. We enjoyed this ramen the most of any spot during our trip, so we made a repeat visit on our last meal, and had another stellar, spicy experience!', ""This is the place I had the best tsukemen in my life!!!

Tokyo Station underground is a behemoth grid of many many things to see for those who are wanting something indoors to do. There is character street and ramen street right underground. It is a large train station that is like the Grand Central Station of Tokyo. Order your ramen in those little coin/vending machines- you put your money and choose your selection and give the little slip of paper to the waitress/attendant. Come early in the morning if you have jet lag and want the morning ramen specials in a couple of stalls. That is, before 10:00 a..m but if you come later, just be prepared to brave the crowds and lines of people that come here to the world famous. We had our ramen at the vegan ramen place called Soranoiro that is not pork based- this is unique b/c most ramen in Tokyo are Pork based, soy based, or salt based.

Circle around and get to know the Tokyo Station if you have time. Or try to ask an employee to point you in the right direction. If you perhaps charade the motion of eating ramen and patting your tummy, they'll probably understand.2) Shopping & Eating. You'll also find other kinds of Japanese and Asian restaurants down there. But you're really there for the famous ramen street ;) There's plenty of shops around as well, including a POKEMON STORE!!!3) Plan to Spend...a couple hours and also some $$. It's a wonderful place to go around and explore each store. Also you can count on eating twice if you walk around long enough ;) I got ramen and then also got Chinese food haha4) Ramen Ramen Ramen. Lastly, although I probably OD'd on ramen at this point, I actually wasn't highly impressed by it. I only tried one shop so my experience is quite limited.

If you are not so much of a beef person, they have chicken-based curry and chicken & spinach curry as well and they are good too. If you are a curry person and have a chance to hang out around Tokyo station (Marunouchi side, not Yaesu side) I highly suggest you go and check it out!"", 'Curry is quick and easy pleaser for me.

Believe me, you\'ll run out of the roux before you finish the rice.I like ""Indian style"" veggie and chicken curry. I like how they are pretty generous with amount of veggie.

They use a Shinkansen (bullet) train to bring out the orders, and it was so fun to watch as it brought out the food! My favorite was actually the uni and the toro combination, but everything was fresh and delicious.

Like some other conveyor sushi places, you order up to three or four items from a touch screen and an tray on the automated belt brings it to you. The prices are rock bottom so I didn't assume the rice was going to be any good. However, the fish was pretty nice and there were even some seasonal items which were particularly good.

I recommend the plum and cucumber or tuna and avocado!I also had the fried chicken, which was very good, but it was a lot heavier than the rest of the meal.

This particular branch is a bit different from the others as it has more sit down tables to cater to the large tourist crowds that are coming in for lunch after visiting Sensoji whereas usually, there are only solo counters for people to sit at. The process is pretty much identical though. You order at the vending machine at the front, get seated and fill out the piece of paper where you circle all the ramen preferences. If unsure, you can just follow the recommended preferences that are outlined in a dashed line. Everything usually comes out really quickly, but this place took a tad longer than usual. Also, make sure to avoid the lunch rush if you can. I got here at 11.30 on a weekday and barely had to wait.

It was so good that we had to go back and eat again.Make sure you try their matcha pudding too! It has the perfect consistency and amount of matcha in it. Perfect way to finish off your meal!The concept of Ichiran is that you pick and pay through a vending machine once you enter. Once you've got your tickets for your chosen items, the employees will seat you and give you a piece of paper for you to choose how you want your noodles cooked, how spicy you'd like it, whether you want green onions or not, all the good stuff. And then, you wait at your table. For the amazing dish to come out. OH, and there is self-serve water stations for customers to grab. The service is pretty good too. There are baskets under the table for you to put your belongings. And they provide wet wipes for you to wipe your hands with. You do not need to tip. Once you're done, you just get up and leave.

I was prepared to wait in line to get to try Ichiran's famous ramen. Lucky enough, there was no line when we arrived just shortly after 9am. Ramen for breakfast? absolutely. At the bottom of the stairs, you'll see a ticketing machine just by the entrance. This is your meal ticket vending machine. We were quickly seated right after, service was efficient and swift. The highlight of the ramen dish was 100% the broth. IT was so rich, \xa0flavourful and perfectly seasoned. The noodles were a close second to the broth. It was perfectly cooked in every way. The noodles not only had a nice al dente bounce to it, but it also held on to the broth so perfectly. The char sui is also a must order with your ramen, it effortlessly falls apart once you take a bite into it. It pairs so well together and will leave you satisfied. I ordered an egg on the side to go with my noodles and pork. I've always been amazed by perfectly cooked the egg yolk is when it comes to Ramen. It was nice and boiled on the outside, but still maintained its rich and creamy yolk on the inside. I mixed everything together once I took my first mouthful. I wish I got to eat this one more time before heading back to Canada. This place has easily ruined Ramen noodles for me moving forward. IT's so good that the reality of not being able to eat this again makes me sad."", ""Similar to other restaurants, you put your money in the machine, you make your choice, take your ticket, etc. except, this place is BUSY.

I thought we were getting a steal, 890 for a bowl of ramen (smidge under 9 bucks) but when we were walking around later, I saw that bowls ranged from 500-800 (5-8 dollars). Either way, it was a good experience. Seating is tight and cramped but they had little baskets for you to pour your stuff in as you ate, it was a nice touch. Before the server takes your order, they give you a sheet to customize your ramen (garlic, richness level, spice, noodle texture, etc.) definitely a cool option since so many folks like things differently.

For vending machine, place money in first then click on what you want. Tickets will come out and once finished, press button for remaining change.

The place is a little hard to find, as we thought we needed to use the elevators to go downstairs to the restaurant. You actually have to go down the set of stairs to go inside. Make sure to go a little earlier than lunchtime to beat the rush! Ichiran is a very interesting experience since you can customize the seasoning stock, richness, amount of garlic, slickness, noodle firmness, etc. You first place your order using a vending machine, fill in the sheet to customize your ramen, then wait for an open seat/table. Ichiran only offers the Tonkotsu ramen, so if you're looking for special ramen broth flavors, this may not be the place for you. I like Tonkotsu ramen, but it would be nice if the menu had a larger variety. Also, my toppings (seaweed, chasu, and egg) were placed on the side, which is nice so that it doesn't get soggy. However, I had to peel the egg myself, and the shell stuck to the egg whites pretty tightly, so that my egg was a torn up mess. Still tasty, but not aesthetic. Overall, I enjoyed the ramen, but I think it was slightly overhyped for me and also slightly on the expensive side. I've actually had better ramen in \xa0San Diego, and I also went to a smaller, less known ramen shop in Japan that I enjoyed better. I would still recommend the Ichiran experience, but if you're visiting Japan, definitely try out the smaller, local shops!"", ""One of my favorite ramen places in Japan, Ichiran is definitely worth the hype. I would highly recommend coming here during off hours especially if you are going to a store near highly touristy areas. I usually go early in the morning when they open. The Asakusa store opens at 8:30am so I usually never have to wait in line if I arrive by 10am.You order via vending machine and there's a recommended set menu that comes with the bowl of ramen, slices of pork, hard boiled egg, wood ear, and seaweed. There's also an order sheet to fill out stating your ramen preferences that range from how strong you would like the broth to be to how much green onions you want which is a novelty to Ichiran. I have yet to find another ramen restaurant that you can customize your ramen bowl based on preferences, but I would recommend going with their suggestion (dotted lines).The texture of the noodle is perfect and the broth perfectly compliments the noodle and sides. I also order a dish of pork topped with spring onions because they are fantastic.""]"

This place is located pretty central in the Shinjuku area. It is a little bit hard to find, but I'd recommend looking at the pictures online to get an idea of where this could be located! As this place seems to be pretty popular, we did have to wait a bit, especially since the place was rather small. We waited for about 10 minutes, but in the time that we were waiting, they told us to pick our order so that as soon as we sat down the food could get served to us - now that's efficiency! We ordered the top tier option for the both of us, as we felt that we'd have the best experience, but unfortunately all the additional sides that were provided with the main dish was hard to understand on how it should be experienced. We had no idea how to eat the sides or how to mix it, and when we asked, we didn't really get a straight answer. The meat, however, was delightful! I absolutely loved the experience of being able to cook it over our own little fire as well! If I do make it out here next time, I'll be sure to do some research on how to better enjoy these dishes!"", 'Very cool concept. The food layout was your standard Japanese dinner. You cook your own beef katsu on a hot plate tower. The katsu was a litte greasy IMO and very fatty, some pieces felt very on rare side.. Tip: cook it well! Aka leave it on the plate for a long time. I think I would try out a different location or restaurant of the same kind next time.', 'When we gave our cab driver the address and he enthusiastically said YUMMY, we knew we were headed to the right spot.

It's small and a bit hidden, but the food was outstanding and you get a lot for your money. Every part of the meal from the ginger dressing salad to the beef katsu itself was outstanding. There was zero wait when we went in and about 10 people in line when we left! Do yourself a favor if you're in the area and go there!"", 'The cutlet is served very rare, and they light an individual grill for each person to finish each piece to your liking. \xa0Two sauces are served, a mountain wasabi (I think) and soy sauce with wasabi. \xa0The mountain wasabi is definitely my favorite, but both work really well. \xa0One the most memorable dinners for my family. \xa0The kids loved it!', ""Arrived at about noon on a Sunday by myself and I had to wait about 30 mins for a seat. Don't let the line up outside fool you, as there is still a section leading downstairs with people waiting. Orders are taken while you are in line so when you sit down, your food will be served immediately. With that said, there is a reason why this place is so popular. I really enjoyed the fact that each person had their own personal grill, making the experience interactive. The beef is of high quality and tender, and you only need to sear each piece for a few seconds before eating. The sauces accompany the meat very well. I opted for the larger portion with 3 side dishes and I was completely stuffed!I highly recommend this place as you get very good value for what you pay.

The 130g is more than enough. The food comes out pretty quick. I love how it is lightly fried and you can cook it to your liking with your personal grill. Its best when it is lightly sizzling because the beef is super soft and tender. For Japanese beef cutlet, it is pretty affordable."", ""I'm always skeptical when somebody finds an eatery via Yelp when Yelp isn't even the dominant review engine in the country in question - and then I remember that I, myself, am also a Yelper and quite a tough one at that so that's something for you to think about.We made our way out here from our AirBNB that was about a 45 minutes walk away and took our spot in line right outside the entrance. An estimated 15-ish people in front of us, it took all of 30-ish minutes for all of us (6 people total, divided into 3 couples entering 2 at a time made it a lot quicker than waiting for a table to seat 6) to be seated and served. What I absolutely love about the system at this place is that you're required to order and pay before you are seated (quite common in Japan) and not only that, they only seat you when your food is actually READY. You can complain all you want about the tight space and limited seats but this system works and was not a hassle at all. We definitely came here knowing that our group would be difficult to seat so separating was not an issue and was expected. Not a problem for us at all.Now, the food. I ordered a 1 side set for myself with the smaller portion of gyu katsu. It was more than enough food for me and I couldn't even finish all of my katsu, which benefited the Mr. because he was quite hungry. The set comes with rice, soup, and I chose the mochi for my side. The katsu was lightly breaded and fried to perfection, grilling it as how it's meant to be handled is quite nice but I prefer my beef on the rare side so it wasn't exactly my favorite texture even if I had only lightly seared it. Of the instructions/suggested ways of eating the beef katsu, my favorite condiment for the meat was surprisingly wasabi. It enhanced the seared meat so well and gave it a very pleasant flavor that I had not expected to experience with wasabi. The rice was cooked just right and the mashed yam went really well with it. Soup was on the saltier side so I was not a fan, but the mochi was amazing.Overall, this was a great experience and the food was better than good. Would I come back and line up for this again? Probably not. But that's just my personal preference with beef, specifically. Do I recommend this place?

I\'ve gone to fancier and more expensive tonkatsu restaurants, and none of them compare to Toyama\'s 1100-yen hire (filet) katsu set. Tonkatsu is almost always soggy on the bottom, but Toyama is always crisp on all sides. It\'s also the juiciest pork I\'ve ever eaten - I\'m not sure what his secret is. In addition to the pork, Toyama has the best tonjiro soup I\'ve ever had, and some of the best rice I\'ve eaten in Japan. His sesame dressing is amazing on the cabbage, and for the pork, please skip the tonkatsu sauce and instead use the ""black salt"" in the little jar to fully appreciate the flavor of the pork. Toyama\'s mother recommended this to me on my first trip and it has always stuck with me. The chef/owner of this restaurant is truly a humble master of his craft. I\'ll never forget when I visited my second time, it had been 2 years since my first and only visit, and he still remembered me, and where I lived in the US, though we only chatted for a few minutes years ago. I find it remarkable that a humble tonkatsu shop in Asakusa has become one of my most memorable places in Japan. Please visit if you\'re in Tokyo at all, not just in Asakusa.', ""Awesome food!

Treated to oysters, sea urchin, salmon caviar and of course the amazing sushi which were the best of the season. You will be served fishes you will only find in the best restaurants and seasonal to Japan. Amazing home-label sake to accompany the meal - it was an unforgettable 2 hour meal which just melted in my mouth. Would definitely recommend to anyone wanting a special evening out!']"
176,Okiya,4.5,3,"[""I thought Gyu-kaku was awesome, but this place puts everywhere else to shame (except some select moo-katah locations)!I wasn't sure what to except, the entrance (by design) is non-descript and tucked away. I wasn't even sure it was the right place. Luckily, I had gone with some friends who have been there before and booked, way in advance I'm sure. It was different than a lot of BBQ places I've gone to, with a large slab of metal in the middle of the table. It was reminiscent of a pancake iron. All the food was ordered, plus some specialty plates. Though a shame I didn't takek pictures, everything was delicious! The owner made sure we were being taken care of (not sure if this is normal customer service), the cook made sure we were making our food right, and each meal was just that - perfect!Add plenty of sake and beer and the night was set. My mouth was salivating at each meal being prepared and was never let down. If you're a BBQ lover, or simply enjoy something different, this can't be missed!"", ""Met up with some of my friends from Japan to have a meal here. A great place to enjoy teppan yaki food! Fresh and tastes really good! In order to eat here, you need at least 5 people. For 5 people it cost 19,000 yen. You have to make reservations in advance because they only have 4 tables! Food's really great!"", 'Juicy deliciousness, but good luck booking a table. You will smell like meat after. :)']"
177,Sukiyabashi Jiro Roppongi Hills,4.5,92,"['I thought I knew sushi. I thought I knew what good sushi rice was. I\'ve been to a few renowned Japanese places and spoken w many self-proclaimed sushi experts who have all told me, ""Jiro is good but a bit overpriced for what it is and there are better...""I am so glad I went ahead and tried Jiro for myself before passing judgment because MY TASTEBUDS now know what EPIC SUSHI RICE is supposed to taste like and now sushi is ruined for me forever. Takashi-San was very hospitable and thoroughly explained every bite. He also affectionately joked how his established is more laid back than the original Ginza location, where they are 100% focused on food and do not say much as they present each delicious piece of sushi. But back to that sushi rice. It\'s warm, about body temperature, with the perfect amount of vinegar... able to hold its shape when you pick it up yet melts in your mouth immediately. Seriously folks. This was a game changer. Definitely a bucket list foodie established that cannot be missed.', ""This review is way overdue. It's been over five years since I've had Jiro's sushi and I still cannot forget about it to this day. The best sushi I've ever had in my life, and I like to think I've had a lot of sushi in my life. From the not so delicious but stuff your face conveyor belt sushi and ayce sushi to omakase in Tokyo, even at Tsukiji Market, back when they still use to do the fish market. But back to Jiro, and how the second son of the great Jiro in Ginza, did something spectacular. I had my cousin make a reservation for me before I came back to tokyo, and luckily he was able to make a lunch rezzy. The only difference between lunch and dinner is about $100 and a few pieces of nigiri. After the omakase, you can order some more pieces of nigiri, from what was had earlier or what was not served and what he offers. Now back to the sushi. This was the most sublime and enlightening experience I've had when it comes to food, not only sushi. The way Jiro explains each piece of nigiri, and how it was prepared to how to eat it, made a world of difference. The one thing he told me that has stuck with me to this day is how to judge the quality of tuna. He said that everyone likes to go for the fatty cuts like toro or o-toro. But he said that the fat content in those pieces hides the true quality of the fish. The best way to really judge the quality of tuna is by tasting the akami, lean part of the tuna. And he was correct. You can really taste a difference in quality when tasting the leaner cut.Each piece was fantastic, but would stood out to me was the smoked bonito, the ikura, and the uni. The ikura was fantastic because it was freshwater salmon vs salt water. And because of that, it was not as salty but burst with flavor as you bit into each piece of roe. And the uni.. oh the uni. Absolutely exceptional and the best thing I believe I've ever tasted. Everytime I think of it it brings a smile to my face. If you have the opportunity, you definitely have to try sukiyabashi jiro, whether it's the one here in roppongi, or the OG in Ginza"", 'We were lucky enough to have our dinner reserved here during our honeymoon. Everything was perfect - excellent food and excellent chef! Ingredient was so fresh! I haven\'t had any sushi for more than 2 months after I returned to the U.S. Apparently, after having so much tasty sushi, my body rejects anything inferior lol Chef was very talkative. He speaks many different languages including English, Japanese, and Chinese. He can also speak some dialects, which is very impressive. He also shared his learning experiences (mostly language related) and educated us about different ingredient. For example, he told us how to distinguish the gender of sea urchins based on color and/or taste. If you don\'t speak Japanese, this place is probably the better option.Toward the end of the meal, we witnessed how tough it is to be an apprentice of a top-notch chef. We can hear the chef ""yelling"" at his apprentices about washing things too slow, not preparing enough ingredients, serving the customer too slow, etc. It was really tough... I\'ve always heard how hard it is to become a sushi chef in Japan, so good luck to you all.', ""Chef Takashi is the second son of Chef Jiro Ono. Takashi was trained by his father at the original Sukiyabashi Jiro in Ginza before setting up his own restaurant, Sukiyabashi Jiro Roppongi. Chef Takashi also appears in the Jiro Dreams Of Sushi documentary talking about his relationship with his father and continuing Jiro's legacy.Chef Takashi might not be everyone's cup of tea. He is in general pleasant towards customers, especially if you take care to observe a few rules (e.g. not wearing strong perfume, not dipping the sushi in more soy sauce...). His English is also remarkably fluent, and he even speaks some Mandarin Chinese and Taiwanese. However, he can be rather blunt and outspoken on certain political issues (only applicable if you speak Japanese), and can definitely rub some people the wrong way. Meals move at a brisk pace. A meal of 14-16 pieces of sushi, plus time for extras, clocked in at just under an hour. (Plenty of banter with the chef, as my wife is fluent in Japanese .) This can feel too rushed for some diners, especially if you just want to take your time. I did manage to take photographs each time before eating, but it is also a good idea not to leave the sushi on the plate too long - ideally, each piece should be eaten as soon as it lands in front of you. Also is customary to ask him before taking pictures as it's his art on the plate.Once you finish your meal, there is no time to linger or order more saki. As Takashi will say, we are a fine dining experience not a bar to hang out unless you are still eating. The freight on this dining experience averages about $350 per person with saki so don't pass out when you look at your Amex statements after Tokyo in general.This is next level sushi here folks and he is a true master. The bar has definitely been raised for this Cali boy!"", 'This restaurant gets a five star BUT with a very big caveat that you may see others and yourself be treated in a way that would not reflect what is typically expected at a three star place. First the food... the sushi was amazing here but very edo style. What I mean is the sushi was more dependent on quality than on seasoning. The good thing was that the sushi was expertly prepared... but the sushi was prepared without any marinade, torching, or smoking (except for the bonito) unlike what you normally see in American omakase places. So, people who are used to that American style may find this sushi more plain. However, without the embellishments, I could tell that the fish was very fresh and prepared with amazing technique. There was nothing offensive and the uni was some of the best I ever had (also the blood clam and the toro!) I loved every piece.Furthermore, you got a lot of food with just the sushi course. I was willing to shell out extra money for the optional pieces at the end of the meal but I was TOTALLY stuffed. I think it came out to like 19 pieces! Did not need to add the sashimi course. I really appreciate how generous this place was with portion compare to places in the US!The chef was SO knowledgeable about all of the fish and techniques. He apparently only started learning English a few years ago but is able to explain all of these great facts to us. He told us all about the different fishes and preparation styles. My boyfriend said that this was an education. It really made the experience even more special. He was sociable and charismatic! However, the ""uglier"" side of this business that people report is also true. There was a couple whose English was not their first language (maybe from Thailand) and they got the sashimi course. Even though the chef told them they were the only ones that got the sashimi course, they were still confused as to why they were getting different pieces. The chef seemed very annoyed with the couple. Later, the couple would leave food on their plates and the chef would tell them to eat it. When they were getting full and the chef told them they should have warn him earlier. He then complained to the staff about them in Japanese. The chef also got mad at one of his assistants and berated him the entire dinner while the student apologized numerous times. I think these sorts of things may damper one\'s meal but I think it is very standard for this sort of field. I like to think that instead of being customers, we are having the honor of eating art created by a master.', ""Boyfie planned the most epic anniversary dinner in the world! I really don't know how he plans on topping it next year :P Aside from the trouble of finding this place, the experience was epic. I was a little intimated going into the dinner because I've heard the craziest stories of how people are pressured to eating as quickly as possibly or whatnot, but that just wasn't the case here. Although Chef Takashi did not look welcoming at first, he really opened up quickly into our meal and made us feel comfortable. I won't lie, it was one of the quietest meals of my life, but it was worth every second. We had about 20 pieces and I was insanely stuffed at the end. We added a piece of abalone which was hands down the best abalone I've ever had in my life. It was so tender and flavorful unlike other abalone I've tried with a tough, chewy texture. The bonita was the best thing I ever tasted in my life... I can actually still taste a little in my mouth till this day... if you are curious as to how it's made, watch Jiro Dreams of Sushi. I still don't understand how amazing they made sushi taste here, but I can honestly say the hype is real. This is after eating at Sushi Dai at the Tsukiji Market (I thought that was the best sushi I'll ever have in my life at the time). We had a jaw dropping reaction to each piece we were given and my boyfie and I both looked at each other was amazement after each bite.I'm ruined forever and I'll forever dream of the amazing sushi I had here. I think I truly understand the meaning of dreaming of sushi ;)Hands down the BEST SUSHI OF MY LIFE."", 'I agree with Barack Obama on one thing...""This is the best sushi I\'ve ever had in my life"" After watching the Netflix documentary ""Jiro Dreams of Sushi"" I was determined to try this family\'s art of sushi. There were levels of preparations before we sat down in front of Jiro\'s youngest son to enjoy this culinary experience.First, emotionally....My husband teased me for weeks that I would either be thrown out of this Michelin starred restaurant or they would plaster ""No sushi for Basi"" posters with my face all over Japan. \xa0Dare I say Why? Well....because \xa0I\'m a full on Deconstructor! I find most places don\'t make their sushi right....too much rice, not enough rice, too little wasabi in between fish and rice, too small piece, too large piece...the end result is I deconstruct my sushi to make my own individual perfect bite cuz I\'m a sushi snob. OK? Fine, I said it. So I was a bit terrified to eat here. I didn\'t want to offend and I was afraid I wouldn\'t be able to finish the entire served meal. I even practiced no deconstruction prior to arriving here and it was plain inedible torture for me and pure entertainment for my husband.Well my fear was laid to rest. Master Takashi Ono is a bigger sushi snob than myself and therefore his care and love that goes into each piece is pure perfection. I didn\'t have to nor did I want to change ANY piece of sushi he placed on my plate. Each piece melted in my mouth in harmony. There were textures and flavors and sensations I have never experienced before. All extremely distinctive and delicious. The rice was perfect, the fish was fresh, the temperature was exact, he glossed each piece with a paintbrush dipped in soy. Or he changed the sauce and told you not to dip it in soy. He described each fish like a sommelier discussing wine. It was like being gently led into a whole new world of sushi craftsmanship.Second, some preparation on etiquette was deemed necessary.....Although Jiro\'s son seems to be more relaxed than his father he is still his disciplined apprentice and now his son also works here as an apprentice, so one should respect that. Photos are allowed but seem disrespectful during dinner. Your sushi is meant to be eaten the minute it touches your plate, so even waiting a few minutes to take a photo diminished that flow. The lady next to us kept snapping photos and the stern look on the chef\'s face still makes us giggle and glad that it wasn\'t aimed at us. Using your hands or chop sticks is both perfectly acceptable. Dress is business casual. Lastly, the reservations...This is the hardest part. The reservations have to be made by someone in Japan; your hotel concierge or a local. Chef Takashi explained this to us that in the past there were too many cancellations by foreigners. They also have to be made exactly a month in advance, on the first of the month, when reservations are taken for the following month. Unfortunately, even with our hotel concierge working a month in advance and spending 3 hours attempting to reserve a seat at Jiro\'s restaurant in Ginza, we were unable to reserve a seat. However, we are so grateful to have experienced his son\'s restaurant in Roppongi Hills.The experience:-The restaurant is hidden away in a business district. There are areas to sit & wander about so we arrived early because there was no way I was going to be late and start off as an annoying American. Familiarize yourself with the external view as there are no English signs. The restaurant has only seven (7) sushi bar seats and two of those are always reserved for his regular customers. If they do not come for a meal, he does not fill them on purpose. There are two tables used only for waiting. We were seated here for about 2 minutes before we were moved to the sushi bar. \xa0 -The sushi itself is indescribable.-Chef Takashi Ono was stern but friendly, talked openly with all of us and answered questions easily. It was interesting to hear him discuss why women cannot be sushi chefs (mainly due to hormonal fluctuations that affect the sense of smell). It was fun hearing him recite greetings in Polish or any of the other 40 languages he knows. I was amazed when he stated his son at the age of 18 stopped being his son and become the apprentice. It was fun seeing his son shy away from the camera and smile and it was evident how hard he works to please his father. A family tradition that demonstrates the dedication of hard work and love of sushi is apparent. \xa0At the end of the meal, he will take as many photos with you as you like and he loves the thumbs up;)-A truly memorable experience of artistic culinary expression within a disciplined, traditional family setting. Sadly, to me no other place (except maybe his dad\'s or someday his son\'s) will compare. \xa0Eat here with caution as it may ruin your sushi dining experiences forever. \xa0BarbaraD dreams of being a regular (even with the ~$300 per person per meal price tag) ;)', 'Yes, we watched the documentary; yes, we were a bit nervous and excited at the same time; and absolutely yes, this was an unbelievable and unforgettable experience! A couple of things; this is not your typical ""let\'s hang out and have sushi and have some drinks"" type of meal. This is a ""let\'s have amazing sushi and learn about the food that we\'re eating."" \xa0Also, it\'s clear that the chef is extremely proud of what he does and they have this whole experience down to a science, so I could see how some may be turned off. \xa0With that being said, the entire staff was respectful, accommodating and dare I say, the chef was quite amusing and entertaining. \xa0We were fortunate to have another ""sushi experience"" the following evening and all I could think about was this meal. Lastly, yes, it is expensive however, we have spent equally with mediocre sushi in comparison, factoring in gratuity, so for me, it was completely worth it! \xa0Book it now!!', ""Overall a really wonderful experience. I loved how chef Jiro was super friendly, speaks a little bit of 40 different languages and tries to interact with all the guests. He even made sure to come out and take a picture with you and send you off after the meal. If you're expecting mind-blowing sushi because of the movie Jiro Dreams of Sushi, then set your expectations lower. Everything was great but only a few pieces were amazing and possibly couldn't be beat by other sushi restaurants -- ikura (marinated overnight in-house so it doesn't have the salty ocean taste), uni (the sweetest uni I've EVER had, they must have first dibs of the top uni!), smoked bonito (never had this at other sushi restaurants before), anago (usually I don't like eel, but Jiro's definitely made me feel differently about it) and of course their famous tamago.TIP: If you don't want to overspend but still get a full Jiro experience, get reservations for lunch! We spent ~$160/person for lunch and left super full!"", ""I was so full that my belt was about to cut off circulation between two halves of my body whilst my growing triple chin was about to drag me off the bar stool. And when the chef asked me if I wanted more sushi I said yes because he is the glorious son of Jiro Ono.Standouts:- Uni, sweetest and creamiest uni that did not taste like coagulated piss- Ikura, house-prepared salmon roe that did not taste like salt bombs from most other places- Bonito, perfectly smoked on the outside like in Jiro Dreams of Sushi- Abalone, tear-jerkingly the best abalone I've tasted- Mantis shrimp, comes with roe, umami AFI left the restaurant a happy seafood octomom""]"

Soul Food House is located near the Azabujuban station in Minato city in Tokyo. The decor is trendy, and the service is on point. The wife is the head chef, and she cooks up some delicious food. The husband does the entertainment (sometimes live music). We had dinner at Soul Food House on a Tuesday evening, so it was just us and a couple. No live music, but they were playing 90s R&B and motown, which speak to my soul.Now for the food - AMAZING! My buddy is from New Orleans, so he told me I had to try the seafood gumbo, and it was SO GOOD! The soup was deep and savory, and there were big chunks of sausage and even crab legs in the gumbo. I also had a cheese steak sandwich, which had hearty pieces of steak covered in cheese and grilled onions and bell peppers. It came with tomato slices and lettuce, which I don't think are typical for a cheese steak sandwich, but they added a great fresh element to the dish.I wish I could go back to Soul Food House this week for more of their great food, but sadly I'm thousands of miles away.

Chicken is fried and meat portion is often much smaller than what it appears to be. BLT, I had something better. Ham & Lettuce is good but still leaves me hungry and make me want to get another one. And that leaves Teriyaki chicken the king of all. It has genuine and generous amount of meat, one purchase of this is definitely enough to fill me up.Each sandwich ranges from 180~320 yen. Teriyaki chicken was 260 yen, if I were correct. But it sure won\'t be more than 350 yen!', 'little koiwai is well known for office workers at this area,ootemachi. they provide various sandwiches. i like this shops sandwiches as i buy it in the morning before works.']"
184,bills Ginza,4,32,"[""My wife and I had the opportunity to visit Japan for two weeks back in January 2020. It's hard to find a lot of international breakfast places in Japan but when we discovered Bills in Ginza, we couldn't have been happier!We literally went to Bills every morning for breakfast and three times for dinner. Their breakfast was most likely one of the best breakfasts I've ever had. The eggs Benedict was to die for! We've tried to recreate them at home but it didn't work out lol. But our ultimate favorite is their ricotta pancakes...OMG!!! We literally had the pancakes everyday after each meal and we still couldn't get enough. We loved them so much that we risked missing our flight to get two orders before we leave. All in all, Bills in Ginza was an amazing experience with a beautiful view of Tokyo. We can't wait to go back!!"", '4.5 / 5.0 - Bills is one of my all-time favorite brunch spots.I love their Ricotta Pancakes (2,200 yen), which comes with fresh bananas and honeycomb butter. It\'s not overly sweet and they give you syrup on the side, so you can adjust the level of sweetness, which I liked.The Wagyu (Japanese beef) Cheeseburger (2,600 yen) was good, but not my favorite. The patty was ok and the cheese didn\'t cover the entire burger. I preferred ketchup (which I asked them for) over the green chili and herb mayo sauce it came with, although my friend liked it. And the ""pickles"" just tasted like cucumbers without much flavor. The fries on the side were nice and crispy, though.Most of the other bills I\'ve been to have been by the water, which you don\'t have with this one. This location right in the middle of Ginza, though, with spacious and comfortable seating.Can\'t wait to have the pancakes again :)', ""Having been impressed by very popular air pancake hot spot A Happy Pancake up in Shinjuku, I felt the need to give the competition a try. While bills dished up some good air pancakes, they fell short of what I'd had at Happy Pancake. Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?The location of this bills in Ginza is impressive, with a 12th floor floor to ceiling window setup that has views of the main street below and the Bvlgari hotel. The service is what you might expect being both classy and attentive. Star. Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?$21.00 for pancakes is... very expensive, especially when you consider that a very similar offering from A Happy Pancake is almost exactly half that price. Even so, bills is clearly a more upscale establishment and given this location I wasn't surprised. Star. Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?bills iteration of air pancakes is fixed with a combination of ricotta and bananas. It's a good combination and the pancakes themselves are good, but they were a bit more doughy than what I'd experienced at Happy Pancake, and there wasn't nearly enough syrup in the mix to carry these over the line. Single Star. Star 5: Would you be excited to go back?Given the price point and the competition, I wouldn't be. No Star."", ""I came here for pancakes and drinks only so I feel like I can only give 4 stars although I would say I had a near 5-star experience.Upon entering the 12th floor, you can immediately sense the posh, modern and aesthetic vibe they have created. Looking around at the aesthetics and decor, I almost felt like I was back in LA. I immediately noticed the wrap-around windows that allow for optimal natural lighting. With the super cute, modern art-deco-ish booths and adorable library room on the side, there really is no bad seat here.We ordered the ricotta pancakes with banana and honeycomb butter, because we already had a previous savory breakfast before coming here (LOL). The pancakes are a fluffy but don't expect souffle pancake fluffiness. Not sure if it's fair to compare the two, as souffle pancakes are purposely made to be overly fluffy and airy, so just keep that in mind regarding your expectations. The honeycomb butter and fresh banana pair really well with the plain pancake and drizzle of syrup. I loved my hot yuma matcha latte and the coffee was good but quite small portions for the price. Prices were steep here, pancakes almost $20 USD and drinks $8 each or more. Bill's is definitely filled with foreigners and tourists maybe looking for a somewhat familiar experience, non-Japanese brunch/breakfast or something more Western-ized. You don't really feel like you're in Japan. Don't get me wrong, there were some local families here but their menu and staff definitely cater to a Western crowd. Nothing wrong with it but if you're looking for more cultural experiences, you won't get that vibe here.Overall, would definitely recommend coming here for a breakfast or brunch experience. Would love to try afternoon tea here next time! One of the best things about Bill's, in my opinion, is that they are open EARLY so you can start eating at 8:30am! This is awesome if you're jet-lagged or just awake early and want to eat ASAP. You'll notice many other establishments (besides 24h casual places) are not open that early. Happy eating!"", ""Bills was definitely not what I expected. I'd imagined it to be a casual Aussie surfer cafe and instead it felt like a glam department store restaurant. Almost all of the patrons were women who were either eating Bills' famous thick pancakes or the 3-story tower of tea cakes. My husband had the shrimp burger which he said was heavily spiced and I had the tea smoked salmon salad. It took about 30 minutes to receive our food, at 2 pm in the afternoon no less. Bills was pricy. The burger, salad, a cup of tea and 2 glasses of white wine added up to about USD 77."", ""This bill's is on the 12th floor. There is a nice view of Ginza, but the windows' nice view is broken up by the paneling/slats.We got seated at the bar immediately whereas waiting for a table would have been about 30 minutes.I tried the raw smoothie (1100 yen or so) and the ricotta hotcakes (1800 yen).To be fair, I'm not normally a fan of pancakes. But according to my friend whose favorite hotcakes were at bill's Odaiba location, the pancakes I had didn't taste very special at all as they hardly had any ricotta taste. Most of the ricotta quality I think was in the texture. It felt like I was just eating my way through mush.I actually ended up leaving half a hotcake behind because it just didn't taste that good (and this was after forcing myself to finish one more).The raw smoothie was decent but wow the portion was small for being about 1100 yen."", 'Very posh spot in Ginza to come have a high end breakfast.We started with a bloody marry and some fresh squeezed OJ. The bloody marry was very unique in that you could taste each vegatable in the glass. They must really infuse the mixers here! The OJ was not bad. Not super sweet but I would probably skip this.Next the cold drip coffe contraption caught my eye so I ordered one and it was very smooth and not bitter at all. Plus it gave me that kick I needed to start my sightseeing for the day.To eat we got the small portion of the coconut toast. This tasted like a french toast with attitude. The butter on the side really put it over the top.Next we had the crab fried rice with poached egg. Soooo yummy. I liked the japanese pickle and kimchi cooked in the rice contrasting with the fried whole crab. Squeeze some lime over thistles and some siracha and your in buisness.To finish it all off we split the ricotta hot cakes with honey comb butter and fresh bananas. Wow this dish was 10/10 you must get this if you come here. The rich honeycomb butter would probably taste good on anything but paired with the fluffy ricotta cakes it was bliss.', ""Bills Ginza is a great place to have a nice lunch or afternoon tea with a great view! \xa0I highly recommend making a reservation and they will try to give you one of the spacious booths with a better view. \xa0The service was excellent the whole time and the afternoon tea was awesome, finished with mini ricotta hot cakes. \xa0The price isn't cheap but I think it is not bad at all, considering the food quality, the service, the view, and the space between each tables for this location. 素敵なランチやアフタヌーンティーに持ってこいのビルズ銀座。予約を入れると眺めのいい広めのブース席を優先して空けといてくれます。サービスは始終素晴らしく、アフタヌーンティーセットは小さなリコッタホットケーキも付いて来て美味しかったです。お安くはないですが、料理の質、サービス、眺め、そしてこのロケーションでの席の間隔を考えると悪くないです。"", ""It was not what I expected.I ordered full Aussie and the most memorable item was the mushrooms. \xa0It was probably the best tasting button mushrooms I had, even though it's a bit salty. \xa0Luckily the egg was not seasoned much so I could eat them together. \xa0The scrambled eggs was nice but was it the best scrambled eggs?? I don't think so, at least not for me.The latte was expensive at 900 yen. \xa0It tasted ok. \xa0I had much better latte elsewhere and much cheaper. This restaurants is full of people who took selfie with their food....... It's good to visit once in my life but not sure if I would return again."", ""The best breakfast I've had in a long time at a restaurant. We made a reservation for 8:30am (right when they open), and the place was packed by 9:00am with a small line forming outside. This bills restaurant is located at the top of a building in the Ginza area, and its interior is spacious and beautifully decorated.We ordered the ~$18 USD Ricotta Hotcakes, which came with fresh banana slices and honeycomb butter, as well as the ~$24 Full Aussie, which came with their gravlax, poached eggs, steamed greens, avocado, cherry tomatoes, bacon slices, sausages, and a few delectable mushrooms. The hotcakes were some of the best hotcakes/pancakes I've ever had, and the delicious Full Aussie dish was full of high-quality ingredients.While the food here is expensive, bills is a restaurant that's definitely worth coming to when visiting Japan, especially for breakfast. Just make sure you reserve or come at an off-peak time to avoid long wait times!""]"

My BF's high school friend bought us here for a catch up dinner. He was basically our translator for the whole meal so I am not sure what he ordered or if it's literally just one thing that they serve. There was an old man who bought up appetizers before the meal. Tofu and a small raw tuna salad of sorts. Then he bought up this small conventional gas cooker, like what you take to camp. He lit it up and started making the sukiyaki. Then he filled each one of our bowls and we added an egg to our individual bowls. He would cook, leave, and then come back and cook again. They also had drinks. We had whiskey highballs and Sapporo. Honestly, I have never had sukiyaki like this before and I am not sure I ever will. It's got a charm of it's own. If you're able to make it to this place and can speak Japanese, put this on your list!"", 'Love Sukiyaki? Here it is!! They only have just one menu. Sukiyaki. A chef cooks Sukiyaki in front of you, so you can taste it at very best timing. メニューは無い。すき焼きのみ。', 'This marvelous little sukiyaki restaurant is in an old family house on a small back alley in Roppongi. It feels like they cleared a spot in the living room to make room for a few tables, stacking knick knacks and curios to make room for their guests. I understand there are private dining rooms on the second floor. The wagyu beef sukiyaki is made at your table and accompanied by pickles, squid bits, fish cakes, steamed daikon, rice and other tiny plates. The beef is cooked with brown sugar and lard (who could ask for more?) and can be served, deliciously so, with raw egg. A little green tea and a small fruit plate finishes off the meal. This little place is a real gem. I highly recommend it. Dinner for two was around 16000yen including two mixed drinks from the full bar.']"

Recommend the tasting menu, even if the salad/soup dishes might not appeal to some :) Price is an imho bargain for the quality of the meat (120 CAD w/out booze) and that staff do the grilling for you. The only sort of drawback is that you get so used to seeing Sushi, yakitori, ramen masters preparing food and suddenly here you've college kids grilling your meat, but they'll do it right. The ambience, hence, can be more like heading to any other Korean bbq joint. Note: If you're not ok with eating raw beef or egg, you'll need to think twice before heading here. Though reluctance to eat raw egg is less of an issue. In either case it is better to go with the a la carte option."", ""Make sure to call ahead and get reservations!! \xa0If you do not have reservations, the pre-fixe menu is not an option....requires at least two hours =( \xa0However, OMG the meat is the best meat I have ever eaten. \xa0Each piece of beef literally melted in my mouth....sometimes I say that as an expression...but this time it literally happened! \xa0All their beef is A5 wagyu and cooked table side.

Went with my family without a reservation and even though we only had one hour to eat we didn't feel rushed and it felt like plenty of time. Service was very attentive and our waiter, who spoke perfect English, helped us choose the meat and then cooked it for us on the grill at our table. The atmosphere of the restaurant was very luxurious. The dessert of shaved ice with fruit was humongous but actually a light dessert and a nice finish to the meal. Only two complaints: they didn't have an actual bartender working the bar, and the entrance is a bit hard to find from the street. Just look for the stairwell covered with a cloth panel and climb up!"", ""This was an all around adventure for us. We planned on going to a different yakiniku restaurant and showed up without reservations not knowing we needed one.

We looked for nearby restaurants but it was too late, I already had the takste of blood in my mouth. Meaning, I was tired of all the fish-based meals and needed some beef! Yelp introduced us to Namaiki. We called and made a reservation for the time it would take us to arrive, and headed straight over. We had a little trouble finding the place as the sign outside had a different name but once again, Yelp had our backs as a member had posted a photo of the very place we were standing in front of. \xa0We were seated in a spacious booth which is really a luxury in Japan. They gave us an English menu but we couldnt make out what most of the words were, as they were the Japanese names for certain cuts/types of meat. We thought about just going with the tasting menu but asked out waiter for suggestions. He asked us a few questions regarding appetite levels and preferences and came up with a plan. He ordered us the tasting menu and added a few things to it. He then wrote down the price, which was a very kind gesture. He wanted to make sure we wouldnt be surprised at the end. This was also reassurng during the meal, as we got so much food! Had we not known the price ahead of time, I might have worried we were being ripped off. Not these guys! they run a classy joint!The food changed everything I know about food. I was given raw meat, went for it and was astounded at how amazing it was. Then one by one in a seemingly endless slew of dishes, the waiter cooked whatever the dish was, TO PERFECTION at our table, and explained the best way to eat it. You guys, pure nirvana. Each thing was the best thing I've ever eaten, and it was only surpassed by the following thing. At one point he bring out truffles and shaves a very generous amount over a piece of meat he has just cooked in a broth. Seriously, this place is foodie heaven. It's been a week and I still think about that meal everytime I'm hungry. The downside of course is that any other food will seem like garbage after this. So you have a tough decision to make!"", ""I went for the course menu, which was pricey but well worth it! I've died and gone to beef heaven!

They have different types of Oyakodon for lunch, but I suggest you go for the normal one (1,000 JPY) if you don't have any previous experience with Oyakodon. As their Oyakodon is popular for its loose top (very lightly cooked egg on top, compared to average Oyakodon out there) -- Keep that in mind if you are not good with half-done egg dishes.

The setting is super small, super intimate, and makes you feel like you are right in the kitchen. They only serve one dish and after you order you can see them make it in front of your eyes.

It only sits 8 people so while it causes a long line, it creates an intimate, homey feel with very personal care and attention. With that said, definitely come early and avoid prime meal hours. But even if you don't and you're forced to wait in line, I would recommend to stay anyway - it's definitely worth the wait. There is no menu - everyone is served tea, soup, and chicken katsu and egg over rice. The only thing they'll ask you is what size you want. The only difference in the sizes is the amount of rice, and it's all the same price (1000 yen). The food itself is incredible. The katsu is so tender and juicy with a perfectly crispy skin. It's lightly dressed with a sauce that adds flavor, while not making the katsu soggy at all. The katsu sits on a warm bed of soft and creamy egg that hugs a mound of rice.

While I was studying in Tokyo, my roommate had recommended me this place once I told them that one of my favorite Japanese dishes was katsudon. After class one day, I decided to see if I could find it! Please note that I am writing this as a visitor from America and maybe it will help those that are interested from my background as well!To start, the place is a little difficult to find. It\'s tucked away on the lower open level of a building, and Google Maps will probably misdirect you to it (I remember walking around that area at least two times trying to find it). It\'s a very tiny shop too, seems like a lot of locals come in. I unfortunately know the bare minimum of Japanese, so I didn\'t know what to expect since I wasn\'t able to communicate. This isn\'t wrong to the place by any means, but it\'s just something to be aware if you are a foreigner visiting. I still got my katsudon haha! But they kind of just hand it to you without question, after a bowl of miso! This did make me nervous because I only had about 40 or so yen in my wallet at the time and didn\'t know how much I was going to pay for the whole meal (if they just kept handing me food ). Once I got the katsudon, I was able to ask (butchered) how much everything was, and they responded 10¥ (~$10) I said, ""for the katsudon?"" No, it was for the whole meal.... shocked over how cheap it was!!! Especially for being tucked away in Shibuya! Now for the katsudon, I can see why my roommate suggested it! It was delicious! The pork was crunchy and tasty! I personally don\'t care for runny eggs (I\'m in the minority, I know) so that was my only dislike about it, but it\'s not that it wasn\'t good! And you can\'t beat the price!So I give it 4/5, only for the unclear directions shown on Google! Otherwise, I definitely recommend checking this place out when you visit Shibuya!', ""The best katsudon in Tokyo? \xa0So far, it's found at Katsudonya Zuichou in Shibuya, Tokyo. \xa0The meaning of the restaurant name says it all: \xa0katsudon (breaded pork cutlet and egg over rice with sauce), and zuicho (auspicious sign). \xa0I will rave about this katsudon because it was THAT good and have never tasted anything better than this. \xa0That is my last meal on earth right now!We had just viewed Shibuya Crossing on the second floor of Starbucks, just outside the Shibuya train station. \xa0This is the busiest intersection in Japan and possibly in the world, with up to 3,000 people crossing the street from all directions during peak time.We were behind schedule and needed to get a really late lunch or an early dinner. \xa0Accessing Yelp to find restaurants nearby, we saw a restaurant specializing in katsudon and had a perfect 5-star rating with 24 reviews. \xa0We turned on the Yelp directions, which noted a 10-minute walk and off we went. \xa0The directions took us away from the people-crazed madness of loud noise and neon lights to quieter side streets and a long alleyway used by the locals. \xa0According to our cellphone, we arrived at Katsudonya Zuichon.But where is it? \xa0There was no restaurant that we could see. \xa0There was a door to a reddish-brown brick building with an English sign that stated that no katusdon was served there. \xa0Was that the restaurant and was it closed? \xa0There were two deliverymen that went into that door and came out a few minutes; we asked them about the restaurant, and they said they didn't know. \xa0We stood there, wondering whether Yelp was correct, as we walked around the surrounding area without seeing any restaurant. \xa0We began to think about looking for another restaurant when we walked through a dark hallway in that same building and lo and behold, there was the restaurant, behind the front wall of the building. \xa0Afterwards, we realized that there was a Japanese restaurant sign in the front, but because we're unable to read Japanese....Katsudonya Zuichou was such a small restaurant with only 8 counter seats. \xa0There was another couple that was waiting for seats and fortunately, they spoke English and confirmed that this indeed was the restaurant. \xa0The couple told us that the food is excellent here, and that there are lines that form out to the street during peak hours.Okay, we're in our two counter seats where we can see the friendly and personable mother and daughter cooking and preparing the meals. \xa0No problem that we don't speak Japanese, as there is no varied menu dishes; they serve only one dish here - katsudon with a clear hot broth with a few somen noodles and fish cake, cold jasmine tea (with refills), tsukemono, and beer if you want. \xa0We just had to choose whether we wanted regular size or large size, both at the same price of 1000 yen, the difference being the amount of rice.The katsudon is made to order, so you can watch your dish being freshly prepared. \xa0The preparation of this dish, I think, is the secret to its excellence. \xa0The steaming, sweet and fluffy rice was topped with a thin semi-cooked egg that resembled a crepe, with a delicious sweet and savory sauce. \xa0We saw the pork cutlet being pounded to tenderize it prior to breading it with panko, then frying it and dipped into a special sauce before placing it onto the egg-rice combination. \xa0Aha, that's the secret to ensure a crispy katsu instead of cooking all together, which would result in a soggy katsu (which is how it's done in HNL). \xa0The flavors were astounding! \xa0The perfect combination of the crispy pork, fluffy egg and rice, and the tasty sweet and savory sauce was simply orgasmic! \xa0Yes, the best katsudon that we've had! \xa0You could tell it was good, as all 8 people were gulping down their katsudon without saying a word! \xa0Oishii!Frequented by locals, this popular small family restaurant is open from 11:30 am to 8:00 pm Mon. to Sat., closed Sun. and holidays. \xa0Shibuya Station, exit 3. \xa0Literally, a hole-in-the-wall restaurant, and I give credit to the Japanese in using every available space that they have for amazing businesses like this. \xa0Katsudonya Zuichou is now a must-go restaurant for our future trips to Tokyo. \xa0Thank you, Yelp, for sending us there!"", ""I am so happy that I decided to satisfy my cravings for Katsu-don here! \xa0If you've never had Katsu-don no need to fear. \xa0It is a very simple dish: with a breaded pork or sometimes chicken cutlet deep fried then topped with a beaten egg that cooks in seconds in the hot oil and becomes the gooey rich delicious goodness that holds the whole thing together! \xa0Served atop a bed of rice (you can choose between a small, medium, or large portion of rice with no variation on price). \xa0Finally a sweet and savory brown sauce is drizzled over the Katsu-don completing this bowl of perfection.I arrived at 11:30 right as they opened and it was already full with a small line of 6 people ahead of me. \xa0Good thing I arrived when I did cause it got even longer. \xa0The restaurant has only 8 seats so you'll have to be patient, but once you are seated the food arrives within minutes! \xa0Love this place and would definitely come back!"", 'Hella tiny spot, but big on flavor.

I could have done without that as well .', ""This restaurant serves one dish--Katsudonya--and it's my favorite Japanese meal so far: it's a bowl of rice topped with a fried egg and something like Schnitzel on top (breaded, tenderized chicken), all covered in a savory sauce.We left fantastically-busy-sensory-overload Shibuya Crossing and headed for this place for dinner around 5:30pm on a Friday night. As we approached, the street got more and more quiet and narrow. Finally, the blue dot on maps said we had arrived, so we ducked into the alley on the right and found this quaint, cozy, teeny-tiny restaurant that seats maybe 8 people (there is no English sign. Look at the attached photos for help locating).Two people who might be father/daughter were bustling about running the place. A pink boom-box perched atop a stack of supply boxes in the corner, playing something pleasant. It's clean and warm inside, and they serve tea and an excellent clear soup to start. The food was ready quite fast, and when we were finished we paid $20 and left.Don't miss this place when you're in the Shibuya area!"", ""First thing we ate in Tokyo and it blew us away! They only serve katsudon which is a piece of pork cooked into an egg on top of rice with katsu sauce (thin Asian bbq sauce). I normally am very neutral about katsudon but this was by far one of the best meals I've had in tokyo. I will definitely be back for another bowl before I leave. \xa0We got there after checking into our place. I picked this because it was the closest restaurant I had booked marked to my apartment. My boyfriend loves katsudon so we ventured to find this little shop. It's in a big red/brown building with flags on the outside. Go into the building, find the shop with about 8-9 seats. Ordered a katsudon; they serve either a large or regular size, both for ¥1000 ($10). The chef will give you a bowl of miso soup and some barley tea. If you need refills, just ask for more tea. After eating the amazing katsudon, place whatever dishes you're done with on the ledge the chef serves you on. Pay and leave. The chef speaks enough english for you to get exactly what you want. I highly recommend this place. We will be heading back to this restaurant within the week. 5/5 would recommend!"", ""like the rest of the reviews previously posted, Katsudonya Zuicho is an amazing restaurant. They have 1 item on the menu and it comes in 2 sizes, both priced the same, 1000 Yen or $10USD. It's tucked in a small area and seats about 6 at the counter. if you're walking down a small and quaint alleyway in Shibuya, don't worry, you're going in the right direction. Like most in Japan, they do the 1 thing very, very well. the pork was amazingly crispy and savory, your meal is also accompanied with a bowl of miso soup, and the shining star shortly comes after. This restaurant is cash only. No vending machines, no meal tickets. Come early, or wait in line, its \xa0If visiting tokyo, this is a must on the stop list.""]"

Flavors: \xa05Although it's an Italian restaurant, the flavors are influenced by Japanese preferences. \xa0For example, there is shirashi (little fishes) on the pizzas, and the dressings have Japanese flavors as well. \xa0Actually, I prefer it this way, but for those who are looking for authentic Italian, I'm not sure how you'll feel about these flavors.Overall, I think we would definitely go back to the restaurant. \xa0I think my boyfriend and I tried enough of their various foods to safely assume that their dinner menu would be just as good. \xa0So maybe one day we'll go back for dinner instead."", 'Really good service, price and food.

They have an extensive menu that you can order fresh from. And the menus are well illustrated and are friendly to English speakers. The menu is full of all kinds of things to try, from traditional to exotic. It was also the first time I've seen fatty salmon, and was I impressed. It's my new favorite cut, and of course I can't find it anywhere back home. The fatty tuna is wonderful as well. Really everything was great and fresh.And the price is right too. Each dish is categorized by price, and the plates they come on are color coded to that price group. When you're all done they add up the colored plates to give you your total. Really a great system. And the prices are very reasonable. My wife and I ate ourselves into hurt and walked out of there paying like $35!But that's not all! If you call now, you also get free bottomless green tea that you mix at your seat. That's right, they have hot water taps and powdered green tea at each seat. And as an added bonus they provided a box full of ginger. I swear my wife loves sushi primarily for the pickled ginger they give you, and she nearly fell out of her chair when she saw this seemingly bottomless box of ginger. Oh and that conveyor belt I mentioned? It also brings by a dessert every now and then too. We had a pumpkin one that was superb.If you're looking for quality sushi on the cheap, this is your place. And it's by the SkyTree, which you should see anyway. Quick friendly service too. There will be a line, but it goes pretty quickly. Well worth the wait."", 'What a fantastic experience! Very upbeat environment with fun staff, the sushi is great and if you go around 9-9:30 PM the line is very short. Usually it seems like the line is around an hour to an hour and a half but it only took my party of 3 about 20-30 minutes to be seated at the booth right on the conveyor belt! Would definently recommend this place for the experience. Pretty decent prices for sushi as well.']"

Throughout the meal they will give you instructions on exactly how to eat each dish - in English."", 'We did not have a reservation and our Mario Cart experience had just ended. We were famished! I didn\'t want to try eating here because the reviews said that the wait is generally two hours. My fearless husband walked up those stairs and asked when we could be seated without a reservation. We were super lucky and only had to wait for an hour. For all you meat lovers out there, this is where you would want to go for a life changing experience. First off, the servers are so sweet and patient. She kindly explained where the meat came from such as the waist and the shoulder. She also asked if we eat raw meat. The sign on the door states ""MEAT"" so you know they take their meat very seriously. Every piece of meat literally melts in your mouth!!! My favorite was the silky beef. Even the raw meat are flavorful. The pairings accentuate the flavor of the meat and elevate them to another level. The server teaches you how to eat it and the combination flavors are impressive. We didn\'t enjoy the welcome tofu as much and we didn\'t find out towards the end that this was extra. However everything else on the menu was delicious beyond belief. Last but not least, we got the basil lemon shaved ice. This felt like we were eating fresh snow. It was fluffy and delicate. It was a refreshing and nice finishing touch! The total came out to be approx 16,000 ¥. We got approximately four drinks. I have attached the set menu and price!', ""We had reservations and opted for the higher pre-fix menu and i am recommending you to just go for it! For the type of meat and food you get, its totally worth it! I was so stuffed.Unfortunately I was pregnant and couldn't eat all the raw beef dishes so the hubs lucked out and got double the order! we started off with the Korean cold dishes like kimchee, pickled cucumbers, and some spinach like dish. \xa0Then moved onto the raw beef. It was like a carpaccio sushi, raw beef with egg on a garlic toast, and marinated beef (felt poke-esq). Either way they were amazing. The rest were cooked and they cook it for you. They are all bite sized but amazing. He tells you what dipping sauces to put it on and it just makes all the bites. I didnt take a pic of the menu so i cannot tell you the order of the food. just trust that this place was amazeballs. To fill you up, you get cold somen with wasabi. Such a nice refreshing way to end the meal from all the fatty beef you just ate. Very good pacing. \xa0We also get shaved ice in the end! Don't get the fruit one, its literally just 2 pieces of fruit. Our friends got the oolong one and that was nice and refreshing. \xa0They ran out of the basiL one or else i would have wanted to try that! oh well. next time! Also this place was easy to get too, off the metro!"", ""Our first choice: Yoroniku, SATO Buriand, Oniku Karyu (not Yakinikku). But all of them are virtually impossible to book. So decided on this place, after reading a local Yelper's review comparing this and sister resto Yoroniku; and the tremendous reviews/awards on Tabelog.This was a revelation based on the quality of the beef and cuts of beef that were superlative. Recommend the tasting menu, even if the salad/soup dishes might not appeal to some :) Price is an imho bargain for the quality of the meat (120 CAD w/out booze) and that staff do the grilling for you. The only sort of drawback is that you get so used to seeing Sushi, yakitori, ramen masters preparing food and suddenly here you've college kids grilling your meat, but they'll do it right. The ambience, hence, can be more like heading to any other Korean bbq joint. Note: If you're not ok with eating raw beef or egg, you'll need to think twice before heading here. Though reluctance to eat raw egg is less of an issue. In either case it is better to go with the a la carte option."", ""Make sure to call ahead and get reservations!! \xa0If you do not have reservations, the pre-fixe menu is not an option....requires at least two hours =( \xa0However, OMG the meat is the best meat I have ever eaten. \xa0Each piece of beef literally melted in my mouth....sometimes I say that as an expression...but this time it literally happened! \xa0All their beef is A5 wagyu and cooked table side. It's pretty pricey but worth every penny in my opinion. The menu is also in English, so no guessing what your ordering. \xa0They also have English speaking servers. \xa0We literally didn't need to lift a finger with preparation, just sit back and enjoy. \xa0Beef will never be the same again.

This ""Namaiki"" serves pretty much the same course dish as Yoroniku but at a much cheaper rate. The quality of beef is obviously better at Yoroniku, but I\'d say you\'ll definitely be happy with what you get for what you pay (almost half the price but 80-90% quality). The atmosphere is rather casual and the customers here are much younger here too. This place should be a very good option when you plan to have a quality Yakiniku dinner with somebody/people you care about near Akihabara station. You wouldn\'t regret coming here.', ""A very nice restaurant for beef. Went with my family without a reservation and even though we only had one hour to eat we didn't feel rushed and it felt like plenty of time. Service was very attentive and our waiter, who spoke perfect English, helped us choose the meat and then cooked it for us on the grill at our table. The atmosphere of the restaurant was very luxurious. The dessert of shaved ice with fruit was humongous but actually a light dessert and a nice finish to the meal. Only two complaints: they didn't have an actual bartender working the bar, and the entrance is a bit hard to find from the street. Just look for the stairwell covered with a cloth panel and climb up!"", ""This was an all around adventure for us. We planned on going to a different yakiniku restaurant and showed up without reservations not knowing we needed one. They suggested their sister restaurant down the street, who also told us we needed a reservation. They apologized profusely, which involved a lot of deep bowing. We looked for nearby restaurants but it was too late, I already had the takste of blood in my mouth. Meaning, I was tired of all the fish-based meals and needed some beef! Yelp introduced us to Namaiki. We called and made a reservation for the time it would take us to arrive, and headed straight over. We had a little trouble finding the place as the sign outside had a different name but once again, Yelp had our backs as a member had posted a photo of the very place we were standing in front of. \xa0We were seated in a spacious booth which is really a luxury in Japan. They gave us an English menu but we couldnt make out what most of the words were, as they were the Japanese names for certain cuts/types of meat. We thought about just going with the tasting menu but asked out waiter for suggestions. He asked us a few questions regarding appetite levels and preferences and came up with a plan. He ordered us the tasting menu and added a few things to it. He then wrote down the price, which was a very kind gesture. He wanted to make sure we wouldnt be surprised at the end. This was also reassurng during the meal, as we got so much food! Had we not known the price ahead of time, I might have worried we were being ripped off. Not these guys! they run a classy joint!The food changed everything I know about food. I was given raw meat, went for it and was astounded at how amazing it was. Then one by one in a seemingly endless slew of dishes, the waiter cooked whatever the dish was, TO PERFECTION at our table, and explained the best way to eat it. You guys, pure nirvana. Each thing was the best thing I've ever eaten, and it was only surpassed by the following thing. At one point he bring out truffles and shaves a very generous amount over a piece of meat he has just cooked in a broth. Seriously, this place is foodie heaven. It's been a week and I still think about that meal everytime I'm hungry. The downside of course is that any other food will seem like garbage after this. So you have a tough decision to make!"", ""I went for the course menu, which was pricey but well worth it! I've died and gone to beef heaven! The waiter was polite and cooked every meal for us, advising us on the best way to eat each piece. Definitely worth trying, especially if you're looking for wagyu beef.""]"

There were a few kinds of chicken meat including breast and thigh from different types of chickens, they all had different textures and all were super tender. Rice portion was on the small side but that's what I liked, the chicken meat and egg were the main characters here.

They have different types of Oyakodon for lunch, but I suggest you go for the normal one (1,000 JPY) if you don't have any previous experience with Oyakodon. As their Oyakodon is popular for its loose top (very lightly cooked egg on top, compared to average Oyakodon out there) -- Keep that in mind if you are not good with half-done egg dishes. It only takes 2-3 minutes from the station and it's not too far from Ueno, so when you are hanging out in the Ueno area, you may want to take a little bit of a detour and come check this out.""]"

Mackerel- grilled perfectly, fish is fresh and not overcooked. Sea snails and sauce complimented the dish well. Green beans- my least favorite, a bit buttery, cooked well, not too soft but not as crispy as I would have preferred. Drinks- bee's knees: tasty and enough gin! I felt warmed up after my first sip. Husband ordered a Gold Rush, which is the same drink as mine but with bourbon instead of gin. He liked his.Ambiance/decor: beautiful and ginormous space! Lighting is dim but our table had a mushroom shaped light that provided sufficient lifting for me to take pretty good food photos with my iPhone. Staff- friendly and can speak English. We were provided with English menus and didn't ask them questions. Our waitress seemed a bit nervous when speaking to us in English, but she was very pleasant. Not the same staff brigs you every dish, but verbal descriptions of the dishes were provided. We told the waitress that we were sharing everything so our soup was nicely split into two bowls for us.

Yakitori chicken hearts were very good as well as the chicken with leek.Finally, the one thing we really did not like is they gave us an appetizer / ""snack"" that we did not order. I assumed this was on the house and only noticing our bill afterwards realized they charged us for it. It\'s a dish of cold buttery egg. They didn\'t give it to everyone - and when I asked them after the meal about it they tried to say it was a tax. Then they tried to say it was the 10% service charge but that service charge was already included in each of the itemized dishes we ordered. It is not expensive (about 500 yen each), but a very dishonest business practice. Not something you would choose to order - in fact it\'s not even on the menu!Much better restaurants elsewhere in Tokyo that won\'t try and rip you off.', '4 solid starsTip: Make reservations, but we got lucky and were seated by the kitchen bar.

I always find myself coming back to this place when I visit Japan!Everything is all self serve except the meats (don't worry though, it's not hard to flag down someone to order more meat). There are different courses of ayce you can choose from, I like to upgrade to the beef tongue course because the beef tongue is delicious here! For the soup base, I've tried a couple but my favorites are the sukiyaki and shabu shabu broth! I recommend getting this together (you have to pay extra for a split pot but it's worth it). Also liked the tounyu collagen!The meat cuts are beautiful and delicious! There is a decent selection of mushrooms, vegetables, and carb options you can choose from on the self serve bar. There is also ice cream for dessert!Can't wait to go back here when I get the chance to visit Japan again!"", ""Love this Shabu Shabu place and it's AYCE! I took hubby here right after our Hakone day trip, it was just the perfect finish to one of our favorite days. I made reservations for later in the evening but we ended up getting here much, much earlier. No sweat, there were seats just before dinner rush hour. We got the Nabezo course with dual pot of Tounyu Collagen and Shio Tonkotsu. Tounyu Collagen was quite interesting, it came with the broth and collagen on the side so you can control how much you want to put it. Collagen made the broth thicker and more bubbly. Shio Tonkotsu was our favorite between the two, we loved the deep flavor. Nabezo course comes with Flank, Chuck, Pork Belly, and Pork Butt. I liked the fatty beef here! Vegetable Market was pretty cool. You can go in and select fresh vegetables, tofu, chicken meatball in a bamboo, noodles, rice, and soft drinks like soda, coffee, and tea. One thing that really shocks me about Japan in general is that the vegetables are a lot smaller in size but much fresher and tastes better. Iced Herbal Tea was a refreshing minty drink! For dessert, I really liked the Hojicha and Strawberry ice cream! If I ever find myself in Tokyo again, I would definitely come back! This place was just a bit hard to find, it is on the 8th Floor. Entrance to the elevator is on the right side of Tiffany."", ""THIS WAS SO GOOD! Loved the flexibility of this shabu shabu and we could pick what kind and how much vegetables you want! The staff was fantastic and the shabu was SO GOOD. I will say, every other shabu i've had has gone soup/pasta/rice and eggs but we stuck with the soup. I'm sure it would be possible to get the second and third parts but we weren't sure how to do it but we were perfectly happy with just the soup.In total we spent about 70,000 yen but it was totally worth it!"", 'A friend highly recommended this place, and I thank him greatly! What a fun and delicious dining experience. They enticed me with All-You-Can-Eat Shabu Shabu and had me at the exceptional quality.Located on the 8th floor, we exited the elevator and were greeted by a host who seated us promptly. Our server spoke some English and explained the menu options and where the buffet area to get the rice, noodles, veggies, and other condiments to create your meals. At the table, there was a ""How-to"" sheet, with English translation, in the correct way to eat shabu-shabu. Very helpful if you are new to this experience. We ordered the Japanese Beef and Pork option, which is the higher grade among the selections, and we also chose two broths. Overall, the food was very delicious. There are so many combinations you can create with shabu shabu, so each bite can be as simple or as complex as your taste buds can take. My only issue was that the tables were a bit small to accommodate all our plates for our party of four, but we made it work. I love shabu shabu, so this was a fun treat to have it in Japan finally!Service was friendly, and the cost for our meal was reasonable for the variety and all-you-can-eat dining. I hope to be back sooner than later.', ""Short Story: \xa0A great AYCE place!Long Story: \xa0I was catching up with a friend in Tokyo and they brought us here. \xa0The shabu shabu is great and located conveniently near a shopping area. \xa0You have several different options to choose from in terms of food and All You Can Eat choices. \xa0You are limited to 90 minutes of eating. \xa0The service is nice along with the decor and ambiance. \xa0Verdict: \xa0I'd be willing to go back!"", ""My boyfriend and I knew we definitely wanted shabu shabu in Japan. After doing some research on Tabelog, I decided to make a reservation for this location of Nabezo for when we arrived in Tokyo. I'm glad we did because it was packed to the brim on a brisk November evening! Nabezo offers a wide range of all you can eat price points - the only difference is the quality of meats. We sprung for the most expensive Japanese beef and pork option, which came with wagyu (albeit a lower grade) and premium quality Japanese pork. This was completely worth it! The beef was melt in your mouth tender, and although I usually don't gravitate towards pork for hot pot, I really enjoyed the cuts offered here. For our broth options, we went with the classic sukiyaki and the shabu shabu, which went beautifully with the meat. The beef cooked in the sweet sukiyaki broth, then dipped in raw egg, made it super silky and we easily put away at least 20 orders LOL. We also loved the self serve vegetable, drink, and ice cream area! I always think of Japanese food as being very health conscious, but I really find vegetables to be far and few in between. We got a great veggie fix here, and the fountain drinks available had a really nice variety. We especially loved the melon Fanta to start, with the detox/digestion tea near the end which was much needed. My only complaint the entire meal is that the service could have been a bit better - our server was kind of brusque which I really find uncommon in Japan. Also, my boyfriend tapped out after the first hour (boo!) so I was left to fend for myself for the remaining thirty minutes, but I can eat an obscene amount so what can you do haha. On another note, some Japanese girls can really pack it in. The girls next to us probably ate 50 orders of meat with udon and rice before even slowing down. Maybe I should move here so I can learn their ways, and so I can eat Nabezo all the time...."", ""Probably the best shabu shabu that I've had in Japan so far. We splurged for the Japanese beef & pork course since it was our last night in Tokyo. The meat was so tender it required 0 effort to chew and basically melted in your mouth. The broth had some flavor but it wasn't overpowering at all, the natural flavors of the meat shined through. I probably met my weekly protein goal after this one meal. Can't wait to come back to Japan and have this again.Side note: I think they sprinkled some crack in their Fanta melon here cause it was so good."", ""First off, the location is on the 8th floor across from Tiffany's. It's pretty easy to miss if you're looking for a restaurant storefront on the ground floor.Made reservations through GuruNavi for a Tuesday night, and when we arrived, there was no one waiting so were seated right away, however, the group of 2 before me tried to get seated without reservations, but from the little Japanese I understand, they still had to wait and ended up leaving, despite continuously screaming how hungry they were in the elevator ride up.We ordered the Nabezo (basic) course with the dual-sided shabu shabu pot in tonyu-collagen and kimchi. We had an Indian waitress who was fluent in English, and she was very helpful explaining everything, even though we frequent MoMo Paradise here in the States and is very similar. The price for the Nabezo course is about $30 U.S., not including the soup base split, and another $15 (or 1500 yen) for their all-you-can-drink alcohol. Since 1 beer in Japan is usually a minimum of 500 yen, your breakeven is 3 beers. Also, a bonus if you're over 65, you get 500 yen knocked off! We only got their beef (in hindsight we should've tried their pork since their pork quality tends to be better than America), and while I normally always get the leanest cut, their fattier beef was melt-in-your-mouth. However, overall, their beef quality is what you'd expect from Japan, which on average is better than the U.S.'s. Having been to a number of shabu shabu places not just in the U.S., it's pretty normal for them to intermix different-quality meat at AYCEs. Across the board, they were pretty consistent in quality here. Also, when you refill the soup base, they actually give you a refill of the soup base and now just water, which I've seen done before elsewhere. However, out of everything, I thought their soup base was subpar and lacking depth of flavor from both.What really pushed them over the edge in my mind was that they allowed only myself to partake in the all-you-can-drink since the other person can't (this wasn't the case when we went to another shabu shabu place in Kyoto). It's great to see they go by the honor system here, but then again, for a table of 2, it's easy to regulate as opposed to if it were a larger group. Their alcohol selection, they only had 1 draft beer (Suntory), 3 sakes (hot and cold), and a few cocktails mixed with shochu (and for sure wine, red and white, and liquor I think). I was able to polish off 3 beers, their yuzu cocktail (mixed with shochu and probably seltzer) and a cold sake. I will say this: you definitely have to figure out your priorities when you do both all-you-can-eat and -drink. For me, that meant sticking strictly with meat and veggies and no starches (like rice or noodles) whatsoever.They have a 100-minute time limit. In our case, as I watched as their lobby filled to capacity, they were strict with this. While it sounds like plenty of time, it isn't if you're a slow eater or would like an additional drink or 2, which is both in my case. The 100 minutes, I later gathered when a hostess told us time was up, starts the second you're seated. It took about 20-25 minutes for the menu explanation and the soup bases and meat to all come out, so in reality, it's maybe a little more than an hour, so use your time wisely. Despite being tourist-conscious, with multi-lingual menus and waiters/waitresses, it didn't feel like they were diluting the Japanese experience but rather making it accessible to everyone. From the food quality to the price and service, Nabezo was the perfect dinner to cap our last night in Tokyo.And a tip: the smell will permeate your clothes. As a tourist, I only brought a limited number of clothes, and so the one I was wearing that evening was saturated in shabu shabu smell. The hotel had a knock-off Febreze fabric spray, but that made little to no difference. It was especially nice of the waitress to place a cloth over things (we sat in the corner so I was able to place my stuff on the corner table space) when I was away getting veggies, but now I know why...the smell!"", ""Pleasantly surprised that an All You Can Eat place was decent. We wanted shabu shabu and had heard about this place. We got the Nabezo combo with the added Japanese beef and pork. It was good to get a lot of fresh vegetables. Between the two of us we couldn't do the all you can eat meat. The staff was very friendly and helpful."", 'Originally i wanted to eat the food of the sumos which is hot pot-esk They were called chanko nabe. I accidentally stumbled onto this place while doing my research on yelp. 4.5 stars with 75 reviews.My initial excitement was due to the ayce option. Ayce meat, veggies, simple drink bar, and dessert. My boyfriend and i opted for the beef tongue option which was a little bit more expensive but it included ayce beef tongue and the nabezo course. The nabezo is the cheapest option which comes with 4 types of meat (beef flank, pork belly, beef rib,.....forgot the last one) Service was fast and it was easy to get full well before the 110 minute time limit. The salad bar had lots of different varieties of foods (napa, enoki, mushrooms, sprouts, leek, potatoes, dumplings, uncooked udon, raw chicken, rice, etc) there was also a sauce bar which was great! I was able to control how i wanted my dipping sauce to taste like. I also loved the ice cream that they offered! The pistachio, cream and butter, and the yogurt gelato were my favorites!! Had servings of each!!! The meat was fresh , and veggie options were abundant. By the end of our 110 minutes we were hugging our distended bellies as we waddled outside the building. No regrets. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking to eat sukiyaki or just some good ol fashion hot pot.']"

But they definitely do provide good service."", ""Based on the recommendation of one of my favorite Hong Kong travel hosts, I decided to try this place for their souffle pancakes. Knowing about their queuing system, I went around 10 am on a weekday to see if I can get a seat but the waitstaff told me that the next available seating was \xa0around 1:15pm.I decided to wait and they asked me to leave a Y1000 deposit which goes toward my meal.

They had different flavors of the souffle pancakes such as chocolate, matcha, etc., but I opted for the original version with just honey and butter(Y1200). I also got a glass of iced earl grey tea for Y300 since I also got pancakes.Due to the open kitchen, it was a bit smoky while they made the individual orders of the souffle pancakes. However, you get to see how they are made by the chefs. The pancakes did not disappoint at all! They were so jiggly, fluffy and just melted in your mouth! I can't decide between this place and Micasadero. The specialty of the pancakes here are that they are made out of rice flour whereas the pancakes at Micasadero was made with ricotta cheese. \xa0In terms of atmosphere, I liked Micasadero more due to the smokiness of the former.Nevertheless, I'm still giving this place 5 stars for the pancakes are out of this world!

When we made our reservation, we had to leave a 1000 yen deposit for each of us. We took the 12:00 spot and returned at about 11:15. Because we were so early, we couldn't get seated, but we could sit along the side and watch the action; it was lots of fun watching the chefs create their pancakes. There were four regular offerings; a savory one with two fried eggs, bacon, and hollandaise sauce over the whole stack, one with bananas and chocolate sauce, one with grapefruit (on the side) and a vanilla custard sauce, and one with sweet azuki beans. There was also a special offering on the day we went; one with cinnamon apples, which was their plain stack with the apples on the side. Each order came with three pancakes, each about an inch thick. I thought it would be way too much, but I managed to eat all three! I had the one with the grapefruit because I watched as he prepared the grapefruit and saw how juicy it was. My husband had the one with the caramelized apples, which came with butter and honey. There was syrup on the counter if you wanted it. The pancakes were incredibly fluffy and light. Even with the sauce, it wasn't overly sweet. It was great to try them, but they were a bit pricey for pancakes. Each of our orders was about 1495 yen. If you take into account that we were entertained *and* fed, then it's not so bad! It's great to try them at least once!"", ""This pancake place located in Asakusa is very popular. It seats around 15 people but it is always full. You would first need to get a reservation time at the restaurant by putting down a 1,000 Yen deposit and tell them exactly how many orders of pancakes you want. When it is your time you would go back to the restaurant and use that 1,000 yen toward your bill. Everyone must at least order one thing. So my boyfriend and I got the custard grapefruit pancakes and a peach juice. The peach juice was not worth it for $7. Although it is 100% juice it just didn't taste that great. What I love about this place is that they makes the pancakes in front of you and everything is so clean and precise. Its like pancake art. Now for the actual pancake I thought it was ok. It looked very nice but it wasn't the best soufflé pancake that I had.

As for pancake flavor, I got original soufflé pancake with seasonal fruits (strawberry) Their soufflé pancake was super fluffy. As soon as I moved the plate, the pancake jiggled! They are like three slices of incredible sponge cake, I also love how the soufflé pancake was not too sweet. Also since every seat is at the bar table, you get to see how the chef made the amazing pancake. Strawberry was super sweet/fresh and I love their handmade whip cream. Whip cream was never my thing but this one was super airy and perfect with the pancake! I love this dessert but I am not sure if it worths whole day to try. I feel like you could probably get as great fluffy pancake elsewhere in some Japanese dessert spot without waiting for whole day.', ""Giving this place 3 stars because - you can get pancakes like this anywhere in Tokyo.

233,Authentic,4.5,53,"['Amazing burger! As an American, I can claim to know burgers. The shop was intimate & eclectic. Burger selection covered all the bases. Service was prompt. It was a taste of home!', ""A fantastic tiny burger place with an irreverent attitude. Loved my Teriyaki Burger. Whatever sauce they topped it with, along with the mustard/ketchup/mayo/thousand island dressing really worked well with the peppery beef patty. It was a bit of a challenge to eat without making a mess, but the wax paper sleeve (envelope?) that they provide to slip the burger into does the trick. Cute 'instruction card' describing how to use the sleeve, too. Fries were crispy and warm, obviously right from the fryer when served. A couple of quibbles knocks off a star: only 1 ketchup packet included with the fries. No extras visible anywhere--certainly not on the small table. Also, what amounts to $4 US for approximately 8 oz. of soda and ice is a total ripoff. Bottom line: go for the burger. But just ask for water to drink."", 'Great burgers. Limited seating so a wait is possible.Although Yelp says they take credit cards, they are cash only.', 'This place has an amazing hamburger...however, for a cola that costs almost $4, they give you about 6 ounces, not even full, with ice...and you pay for the refill.', ""Located in Akasaka, not far from Akasaka Station is a burger shop known as Authentic which many people in Tokyo consider as one of the best burger shops to eat at.So popular that there is a line to get inside as it's not a big location but there is limited seating.My thoughts about Authentic and the waiting is that it was a bit tricky to find the location, searching for the slope and hoping Google Maps didn't fail me (which it did). \xa0But fortunately, many people, seems to know about Authentic that they were quite awesome to help point me to the right direction and that was to follow a certain slope.It's a little hidden but how I was able to find it was via a line of people waiting to get inside for lunch.You'll see a red brick building with a sign that is outside on a corner.Posted on the door is the weekend, dinner and lunch hours. \xa0So, do not go to Authentic on M-F between 3:30 p.m. to 5:30 p.m., as it's closed in the afternoon. \xa0The restaurant opens from 11:00 a.m. to 3:30 p.m., then 5:30 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. \xa0The hours are Saturday/Sunday - 11:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m.Once you go inside, you are seated on the counter if alone or the limited seating if with a group.The location has a cool western diner vibe. \xa0You have ketchup, tissues and the wax paper to hold your burger, so you don't have the burger juices dripping around.The menu offers everything from the Tokyo staple - avocado cheeseburger, but they also sell double cheeseburgers, chili cheeseburgers, a teriyaki burger and also a broccoli burgerI ordered an avocado cheeseburger with an egg add as extra.It's important to note that wait time is by queue, so there is a bit of a wait for the burger if there were a lot of people (especially a group) in front of you, so might as well chill, pick up a Metropolis Magazine on the side or read the news or peruse your smartphone as you wait for your food.I found the prices quite reasonable and also cheaper than most premium burger shops in Tokyo. \xa0 That's important to know as I always say...Y1500 is the norm in terms of burger pricing, that is a burger and fries. \xa0Drink not included. \xa0And some places charge even more, some are more warranted than others.The burger was delicious, even the sauce used and the bun. \xa0It's important to note in Tokyo, there are few places that do a lot of black pepper, this is one of them. \xa0So, you may want to mention if you want a little black pepper (say - Black pepper o sukoshi kudasai) when you order.But the owner wanted to create an authentic burger place in Japan and he has succeeded. \xa0Delicious burgers, no doubt one of the best in Tokyo, but because of it's popularity and it's only one man, the owner making the burgers (the waitresses will order and get the drinks and serve you), just know that in advance and things are all good.I don't know if this burger shop will tailor the meat for those who are selective on how the meat should be prepared. \xa0I know there are some people who are quite selective with that. \xa0But you may want to ask the waitresses (have your google translator app ready with the question, just in case) when ordering.But overall, Authentic is always a burger place worth visiting if you are in Akasaka and again, one of the better burgers in Tokyo and is on my top 10 burger shops to visit!"", ""I took my friend here after reading an article on the best burger places in Tokyo, and Authentic did not disappoint. While it was quite an uphill walk from the station, its location did not detract from the quality. \xa0I ordered an avocado burger and my friend got the peaches burger. Mine was delicious! Especially after I had been craving something closer to home. But Authentic's burgers have a Japanese twist to them as I read they use wagyu beef. You can really taste how succulent the meat is. The bun was also amazing, it was chewy and dense, similar to a Shake Shack burger. The fries were crispy and perfect, and this is coming from someone who never finishes their fries, but I found myself cleaning the plate.However, I would say that the last 1/4th of my patty was seasoned a little too heavily with black pepper. It wasn't enough to remove a star considering the overall quality. My friend was less satisfied with her burger citing that the peaches didn't add anything in taste or texture. It's too bad, but I would recommend ordering something else."", 'True to its name, this place serves an authentic burger, although one that\'s a tad expensive. The patty is reasonably good, albeit a bit thin. It\'s topped with a particularly delicious sauce and rests within a nicely done bun. \xa0Overall, this is a fast-casual, owner-run experience. Is it the ""best burger ever"" as some other reviewers noted? By no means. But is it a satisfying, comforting reminder of home if you\'re a Western traveler feeling a bit ""lost in translation"" here in Japan? By all means.', 'Looking for a picture perfect hamburger? You know, like the high resolution photographs in a gourmand magazine, or - dareisayit - plastered on the side of a McDonalds semi truck? Look no further! Aesthetically, these burgers are works of fine art. And have the flavor to match.', ""Unreal burgers. Attention to detail was amazing- the guy obviously is in love with his craft.

The broth was hearty and flavorful without too much salt. The noodles were not springy, but tasted fresh. The seating area wasn't too crowded and there were bins for our belongings."", ""After reading about Ramen Street in Tokyo station, I felt the need to try it. It's located in the lower level of Tokyo station. Like many other ramen establishments, there is a vending machine where you pay first, make your selections, and receive tickets. Hand the tickets to the wait staff and have a seat. One of the most interesting things that I saw here for the first time were the baskets that you can use to store your bags so that they don't touch the ground.I ordered the tonkatsu ramen with all the toppings. It includes 2 large, fatty pieces of pork, an egg, 2 sheets of seaweed, freshly cut leeks, freshly cut mushrooms, and what I can only describe as a roe pocket. I thought the pork broth was quite hearty and creamy. The pork pieces were delightfully soft. The taste and texture of the medium sized noodles were similar to ones that I've had in Toronto. What I didn't like was the roe pocket. It was very salty.Overall, it was an excellent ramen experience and I mostly enjoyed my ramen dish."", ""Probably the most disappointing ramen I've had so far in Japan. The tonkotsu was lacking the rich pork flavor and the eggs were over cooked in my opinion. I guess that explains why there was no wait for this place when we arrived, but we have also seen this place packed during other occasions."", 'Inside Tokyo station-part of the ramen street. I tried a lot of Tonkatsu ramens during my stay in Japan and this one was very average for me. The broth was not rich enough and my egg was over cooked. There is room for you to place your suitcases. I went around 4:30pm on a Tuesday and it was pretty empty.', ""This is a tonkotsu ramen place on ramen street at Tokyo Station. Tokyo Station is ginormous and it was an adventure just finding ramen street itself and finding this place. This place has a line out the door so it's not too hard to miss (but all the other ramen places also have lines out the door)! As for the tonkotsu ramen here, it's definitely pretty good. It has a rich, porky broth but it doesn't do justice like my other tonkotsu favorites such as Ichiran and Ippudo. It's a decent bowl. My husband felt like the portion size was small though. I felt like it was decent. We also got the tonkotsu with sardine broth as well. I enjoyed that as well, my husband didn't really like it but I felt like the sardine broth gave a different depth to it (it's pretty much like dashi and tonkotsu). I love garlic and there's raw garlic in a little container, so I added a generously serving of garlic. There's also some pickled vegetables which I added as well, which was delicious.Oddly enough, for the tonkotsu broth, it is the thinner noodles but for the sardine broth with tonkotsu, it is the thicker noodles. Overall, it was a decent place but nothing extraordinary - there's probably better places nearby."", ""If this is your first time on Tokyo Station's 'Ramen Street'; you're probably both overwhelmed and torn as to where to stop off. Fear not, friend, just go with the shortest line because all of them are brilliant to include Oreshiki Jun.Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?The process should be familiar if you've spent any amount of time within the Tokyo ramen scene, but if you haven't you walk up to the machine, place your order, have a seat, and shortly you'll have some truly sensational ramen in front of you. Star Granted. Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?At just about any contemporary ramen spot in Tokyo you'll pay just shy of 1000 JPY for some standard Tonkotsu, which is exactly what you'll pay here at Oreshiki Jun. While the serving at Oreshiki was a bit smaller than what I waited two hours for at Ichiran, it was more than enough nonetheless. Star Granted. Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?Having stopped off at Ichiran Shinjuku upon landing in Tokyo, I honestly didn't think it could be topped, but Oreshiki Jun matched it right out of the gate. The broth was sensational, the pork cutlets flavorful and crispy, and the level of spice was perfect. The noodles? Perfectly cooked and flavorful - what more do you want? Dual Stars Granted.

No Star Granted."", 'The first time I went to Tokyo, I stumbled upon this place and ordered their Tonkatsu Tsukemen w/ Char Siu (dipping ramen) and it was amazing. The curly, egg noodles had the right amount of bite to it and was perfect for dipping since it ""grabs"" the broth as you dip. Additionally, the broth that you dip them in was simply divine. I had dipping ramen at multiple places before, but this was the one that ""haunts"" me. I loved it so much that I planned a second trip back to Japan just to have this bowl of Tsukemen again. I\'m exaggerating, but I definitely made sure I went back to this place on my most recent trip to Tokyo. Once you\'re done with the noodles, you\'ll usually have some leftover dipping broth. At which point, you can tell the server to add a bit more broth (this is usually lighter than the dipping broth itself); this is to dilute the dipping broth so you can then drink it since the dipping broth is really heavy by itself. I also ordered a side of Gyoza. I\'m not sure if it\'s because I was hungry or not, but the Gyoza\'s were delicious as well.', 'Environment: Gives a traditional Japanese vibe (check pictures). Everyone is high-energy, loves what they do, especially the chefs, and gives you ample room to move around, set your bags on the side (even if you are traveling)Service: Without a doubt, excellent service even when you are confused at the outside vending machine trying to figure out which ramen to buy. PLEASE NOTE: they WILL ASK for how ""soft/hard"" you want your ramen noodles (soft, medium, hard). Drink: Pitcher of water for easy accessibility without needing to call over the serverFood: Got the #1 which is the most famous (soft noodles). Please check my picture, this is NO JOKE. This is as authentic as ramen gets and the broth is extremely rich. Although, the dipping ramen can be EVEN MORE rich and flavorful, this one included with broth and noodles should most certainly not be ignored!Price: For about $10-12 USD for a bowl of ramen, there is not much better ramen you can get unless you travel elsewhere outside of Tokyo.

Difficult to find, please refer to pictures to see what it looks like on the outside!!', ""Great ramen restaurant located in the ramen street of Tokyo station. Came by this restaurant when I saw all the long lines at the other places. Decided to go with the classiic tonkotsu option, which was really good. The broth was rich and flavorful -- just a tad on the heavier side that I would have preferred. The noodles were great -- very firm and thin, but I wish the portion size was a bit more. The chashu was definitely the highlight -- huge slabs of meat and fat from the pork just melted in my mouth. The soft-boiled egg was also fantastic. Interestingly they added some fish eggs topping as well, which was a bit of surprise as I've never seen that before. It was interesting though I felt a bit out of place with the other parts of the traditional ramen. Nevertheless, good meal for the price."", ""Located on Ramen Street on the basement level inside the Tokyo Station. I was eyeing for Rokurinsha, but there was a mob of people outside. This one had a smaller line, so we made a split decision. Order via a vending machine; everything is super easy to understand. I ordered a Tsukemen with extra noodle and an egg which confused them because, as they informed me, it would be 'very big', but I knew what I was getting myself into! I liked tsukemen a bit more in Japan because the noodles are a bit thicker than what they offer in their ramen, plus they are a bit more aromatic. The ones here were no exception. They were also slippery and firm. Broth in the noodle soup was fairly mild and flavored evenly. My real focus was on gobbling up those noodles and I did eat most of them, but I took on a bit more than I could chew! Satisfied nonetheless... with the tsukemen. As for the tonkotsu ramen, the boyfriend wasn't a fan, but I didn't get to sample it since I was way too into my dipping noodles.""]"
